            <p>Over the summer, <em>Immerse </em>published this <a

                by the Knight Foundation, exploring the question “In what new ways might museums and cultural
                institutions engage audiences through immersive experiences?”</p>
            <p>The pieces were wide-ranging: from a look at the <a

                have to do with our mission of “creative discussion of nonfiction storytelling?”</p>

            <p>The answer is that, nowadays, it’s much harder to draw bright lines between cutting-edge art, fiction,
                documentary, and journalism, as practitioners are all experimenting with the same new tools and
                platforms. While the intentions may be different, the forms are similar, and in turn these forms shape
                content producers’ decisions in parallel ways.</p>
            <p>In other words, nonfiction storytellers building untested user experiences are as likely to learn from
                artists, game designers, programmers, or architects as they are from peers in their own field. Plus, the
                frisson of repurposing forms and approaches associated with a different practice can add resonance to
                now-calcified practices for representing reality.</p>

                    Future of Journalism</a> is supporting artist-journalist teams in their own efforts to reimagine how
                stories are told. Small grants, from $500-$5000, allow these teams to report on issues relevant to both
                technology and democracy, including data privacy, political influence campaigns, and artificial
                intelligence. Such collaborations have the potential to be published in major outlets—for example,

            <p>“Artists deserve a place at the table to talk about what’s happening in their communities,” says Marisa
                Mazria Katz, Eyebeam’s editorial director. “How do we connect their very valuable work to wider
                audiences?” She’s no stranger to this nexus—she’s the editor of a new book, <em><a
                        href="http://creativetime.org/blog/2019/09/17/celebrating-5-years-of-inquisitive-journalism-from-creative-time-reports-with-the-publication-of-artists-on-the-news-in-collaboration-with-paperchase-press/">Artists
                        on the News</a></em><em>, </em>which features selections from <em>Creative Time Reports</em>, a
                now-shuttered online platform that she co-founded.</p>
            <p>She says that she hopes the Eyebeam Center for the Future of Journalism can help “time poor” editors in
                an industry under siege to understand why working with artists can be powerful. There are still lots of
                editors who “hear the word art and don’t think that belongs on A1,” she says, but artists have “always
                been able to upend how we see the world,” and maybe can even “help think through the future of the
                industry and be that key voice that editors and publishers need right now.”</p>

            <p>Of course, both art and technology have long been a part of journalism—from the printing press, to
                editorial cartoons, to <a href="http://www.aparchive.com/partner/British%20Movietone">Movietone</a>
                newsreels, to the whizbang interactive maps that dominate today’s cable news election coverage. But
                finding ways to artfully deploy these various forms for social good is the real challenge. That’s why we
                cast a wide net at <em>Immerse</em>, while still trying to keep enough critical distance to not just
                champion but dissect experiments in nonfiction media and adjacent fields.</p>
            <p>So, next time you read something in our pages and wonder “Why are they reporting on this?”—that’s what
                we’re up to. And the next time you’re making something that doesn’t quite resemble traditional
                documentary or journalism, well, let us know what <em>you’re </em>up to.</p>
