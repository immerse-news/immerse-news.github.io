            <p><em>Robot Remix XR is a Virtual Reality exhibition at Sp[a]ce Gallery in Pasadena, California. It runs
                    every weekend until September 8th. You can get tickets </em><a

            <p>Milo Talwani and I met working for the Sundance Institute New Frontier Programs. Milo is a musician and
                creative technologist, and I am a filmmaker and Virtual Reality creator. We are fascinated by virtual
                reality as a way to experience stories and other realities. Both of us are motivated to get fellow
                artists into headsets, so they can see what is possible in the medium, and start creating. We also want
                our “non-VR” friends to see how cool it is. <em>See?! We aren’t crazy!</em></p>
            <p>We were approached by Sp[a]ce gallery to curate an emerging technology show to run alongside a physical
                exhibition, <em>Robot Remix, </em>curated by illustrator <a
                    href="http://www.marktoddillustration.com/">Mark Todd</a>, which incorporates mashup action figures,
                robot paintings, and kinetic art.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>We decided this would be a great opportunity to work together and build the kind of exhibition we would
                love to attend — a combination of award-winning and high quality virtual reality experiences in a laid
                back, welcoming atmosphere, with enough trained staff to make you feel comfortable. We also wanted to
                try our hand at creating a family friendly line-up — the kind of show you could pop into with your
                friends or family on a weekend during a hot LA summer.</p>

            <h3 id="27dc"><strong>What makes great VR? When you know, you know.</strong></h3>
            <p>The art pieces in the physical installation were our guide as we set out looking for XR experiences. We
                looked for pieces that fell under two categories: “Robot” (robots, pop culture, fantasy/sci-fi) and
                “Remix” (remix culture, mashup, collage — projects that play with reality, challenge your perceptions).
                It was a goal of ours to curate high quality, award-winning experiences. For our July line-up we are
                exhibiting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>VIRTUAL VIRTUAL REALITY</strong> — <em>Tender Claws</em></li>
                <li><strong>INVASION!</strong> — <em>Baobab Studios</em></li>
                <li><strong>GLOOMY EYES</strong> — <em>Jorge Tereso and Fernando Maldonado with Atlas V</em></li>
                <li><strong>UNCEDED TERRITORIES </strong><em>— Paisley Smith and Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun</em></li>
                <li><strong>MICRO GIANTS</strong> — <em>Yifu Zhou</em></li>
                <li><strong>YOUR HANDS ARE FEET</strong> — <em>Amelia Winger-Bearskin and Sarah Rothberg</em></li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="2ad4"><strong>I want to see EVERYTHING!</strong></h3>
            <p>Film festivals and conferences have large audiences that pay a pretty price for a ticket to attend
                exclusive events. The names of these conferences and festivals are enough to create a sacred bond of
                trust between exhibitor and audience. There is a high caliber of work that is accepted. This means that
                audiences will attend your event, you will sell tickets, and audiences will trust you enough to go into
                your projects and tell their friends.</p>
            <p>On the flip side, audiences have high expectations but seeing VR experiences can be competitive and
                require experience and a viewing strategy. The truth is, many people often leave disappointed in not
                seeing all of the projects they wanted to.</p>
            <p>Milo and I really wanted to see if we could create a space for audiences to view each of the projects at
                the exhibition. There are so many reasons why viewing a variety of projects in an exhibition is
                important. As any visual arts show, when placed next to each other, the pieces speak to each other. The
                projects we chose to exhibit range from experiential games, to cinematic VR, to interactive art
                experiences. Each of these projects tells a story in a unique way — not just in terms of story, but how
                we touch, feel, and move through the story. For an audience member who has not yet become fluent in the
                language of virtual reality, experiencing this range of projects feels important. It also informs future
                creators on what is possible, and where there is room for innovation.</p>

                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <h3 id="2bc1"><strong>Perfecting the vibe</strong></h3>
            <p>Another priority was creating a welcoming, fun, relaxed space. In order to achieve this (on top of
                designing a cheerful space) we need to limit our ticket sales per hour so that we control the number of
                people in the space. We want people to actually <em>enjoy</em> seeing virtual reality. When audiences
                have to race around, they don’t have any time for reflection. Personally, I like to do a little VR,
                chill out, take some space, then get back into it. Comfortable chairs are a must. Every person who
                enters the show must have access to a headset, and staff must be available to help get them set up and
                explain the VR they are getting into.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/534/0*pTphwycAuTUjvxds" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span></figure>
            <h3 id="ad7c"><strong>Hot, Fresh Challenges</strong></h3>
            <p>With a comfortable viewing experience as our priority, new, hot, fresh, challenges are hurled at us. In
                an ideal world, we would sell all of our tickets at our desired price, and all would be perfect.
                Limiting our ticket sales means that in order to cover our costs (staff, technology and installation
                costs, artist and screening fees) and pay our artists for their work, we need to entirely sell out.</p>
            <p>With Robot Remix XR, we hope to appeal to a VR-curious audience. One of our challenges is that this fresh
                audience does not know they want to attend our event until AFTER they get out of the headset. Once they
                see and experience the incredible VR work, they are sold, but up until that point they are not entirely
                sure this is something they are interested in. So spending money on a ticket to attend is a huge
                barrier. How do we communicate the magic of VR to audiences who don’t know they might like it?</p>
            <p>We also have the added challenge of only being open on weekends, during a hot summer in Los Angeles. How
                do we let people know we are air-conditioned, family friendly, and a great place to beat the heat?</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/534/0*scSHgo4VYBJjWb1M" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span></figure>
            <h3 id="a039"><strong>Where do we go from here?</strong></h3>
            <p>Every weekend we get one step closer to solving these challenges. We get better at talking about the show
                to friends and potential attendees and we’ve played around with ticket prices and accessibility.</p>
            <p>Once we figure out these details of exhibiting VR, it’s a gift that will keep on giving. It’s a show we
                could travel with and install around the world. We are both excited by the possibilities of where this
                show, and future XR shows, will go. We hope to democratize access to virtual reality for audiences, and
                inspire others to create and innovate in the emerging tech space. If we can do it, so can you!</p>
