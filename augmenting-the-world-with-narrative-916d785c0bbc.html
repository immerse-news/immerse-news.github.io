            <h3 id="c695">Has “Audio AR” finally found its moment?</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>Audio affects our perception of the physical world. We understand three-dimensional space by
                        using our vision but also by the character of sounds we hear. If these sounds are manipulated
                        and changed, then our perception of reality can be drastically affected. —</em>Janet Cardiff</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I became interested in audio AR almost a decade ago, before “augmented reality” had become an everyday
                term. In fact, back then we couldn’t quite agree on a term. Some used “locative audio.” I used “GPS
                location-based apps.” None were very snappy. In essence, what we all meant was<strong> layering audio in
                    space</strong>. And it appealed to me because it had the potential to change our relationship with
                the real world around us.</p>
            <p>To explain this grand claim, let’s go right back to basics. Take, for example, tour guides. They tell you
                about the new city you are visiting, which changes the way you understand and relate to that place.
                Museum audio-guides do the same thing. By learning about the painting you are looking at, you begin to
                appreciate different things, to understand the work in a new way.</p>

            <p>By overlaying narrative in space, you can imbue that place with meaning, augmenting the world.</p>
            <p>Artist <a href="https://www.cardiffmiller.com/">Janet Cardiff </a>understood this power of “audio AR.”
                Back in the 1990s, she built a number of audio walks. The technology was basic. To hear <em><a
                        href="https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/the-missing-voice-case-study-b/">The Missing
                        Voice</a></em>, you needed to check out a Walkman at London’s Whitechapel Library. To keep in
                sync with the piece you’d have to walk in time with her:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>I want you to walk with me… Try to walk to the sound of my footsteps so that we can stay
                        together.</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Despite the crude tech, Cardiff seems to have instinctively understood some of the most powerful spatial
                storytelling techniques. Like a tour guide, Cardiff talks directly to you, pointing out details as you
                travel with her, highlighting the things you walk past every day, making you zoom in on them, but
                poetically, interweaving them in her noir-like plots.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>I hope we see an egret. Yesterday I saw two flying over the lake, their big white wings floating
                        above the water as they circled and then landed on the other side.</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/543/481/1*nV1kkE042t1e_EShBk1LYw.jpeg"
                    width="543"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>Cardiff also directs our attention through the use of field recordings. Using the hyper-real binaural
                recording technique (which places microphones beside your ears), she brings sounds in and out of focus.
                An invisible car swerves past you, sirens, horse clopping around you, an accordion players. You turn
                around to avoid them and see nothing there.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>It’s loud here, isn’t it? When you are in a city like New York you have to think of the sounds
                        like they are a symphony, otherwise you go a bit crazy.</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>As Steven Poole, my colleague at the <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com">Guardian</a></em>, <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/nov/17/arts.highereducation1">wrote</a> of
                Cardiff’s work, “You experience two realities at once. And you can begin to play this game afterwards,
                imagining that the apparently random street scenes around you are carefully choreographed and
                soundtracked to a mysterious design.”</p>
            <p>Back in 2010, though, I wasn’t thinking about these clever storytelling techniques. I was thinking about
                technology. I’ve never been a good sleeper, and sometime ideas keep me up. One night it was locative
                audio. I had been making a series of downloadable walking tours with my radio producer friend Lucy
                Greenwell, and, at about 4 a.m., I had a realisation that with smartphones and GPS all the painstaking
                timing and clicking and pausing could stop. The phones could trigger the audio files by your location.
                But it wasn’t only the timing, the walks could also be nonlinear — you could make audio experiences
                where people could roam free.</p>
            <p>I convened an emergency lunchtime meeting near the <em>Guardian</em> at the local Italian deli to discuss
                the idea with Lucy. After much painful fundraising we made <em><a
                        href="http://www.hackneyhear.com/">Hackney Hear</a></em><em>, </em>a GPS locative audio app set
                in London’s poor yet rapidly gentrifying borough of Hackney.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/550/230/1*rLGabzmiBB2MnkAM8hS--Q.jpeg"
                    width="550"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>We interviewed gang members, artists, and historians. We commissioned music, poetry, and short stories.
                We used Cardiff’s techniques throughout — as you walk through the park, you’d hear the voice of novelist
                Iain Sinclair invite you to sit on the bench you are approaching. You’d sit next to his invisible
                presence and he tells you about the area he loves and has lived in for decades. We used binaural “ghost”
                recordings throughout. You’d walk through a ghostly market being set up and then cleared away. In the
                park you dodged footballers and hoola-hoopers.</p>
            <p>You could do all this without poking at your phone. At the beginning of the experience you were told to
                put your mobile in your pocket and explore. If you tried to walk out of the zone a voice would whisper
                at you to turn around.</p>
            <p>Lucy and I were hooked. We set up a company called <a href="http://phantomproductions.co.uk">Phantom
                    Productions</a> to make more sonic AR experiences, which we did — in <a
                    href="https://thenextweb.com/uk/2012/06/22/soho-stories-app-from-the-national-trust-explores-one-of-londons-most-seedy-swinging-districts/">Soho</a>
                for the National Trust, in New Jersey about hurricane Sandy, another in <a
                    href="https://calvium.com/projects/guardian-street-stories/">Kings Cross</a> for the
                <em>Guardian</em>.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>We began to devise an approach as we learned what worked and what didn’t. In fact, our training as radio
                producers didn’t help much. We were used to describing scenes, which is not only irrelevant when you’re
                physically there, it’s downright annoying.</p>
            <p>Others around the world were doing the same: in Berlin, the audio company <a
                    href="https://www.rimini-protokoll.de/website/en/project/50-aktenkilometer">Rimini Protokoll
                </a>made a “Stasi audio walk” using archives; sound artist <a href="https://halseyburgund.com/">Halsey
                    Burgund</a> developed an open-source contributory audio AR platform called <a
                    href="http://roundware.org/">Roundware</a> for his installations; and the British company <a
                    href="https://calvium.com/">Calvium</a> built an interface to make it easy for producers to build
                their own experiences, allowing companies such as the Royal Shakespeare company to build their own apps.
                Musicians too were experimenting. <a href="http://augment.audio/">RJDJ</a> used the microphone on
                people’s phones to make music by live-processing the sounds.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/295/171/1*rZr99abvg4MZthvyAi840g.jpeg"
                    width="295"><label class="margin-toggle" for="17489707918775168738">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input

                    class="marginnote">Roundware</span></figure>
            <p>For many years this work in locative audio chugged along quietly, minding its own business, waiting for
                its time to come.</p>
            <p>This time appeared to be in 2015, when former Groupon founder and entrepreneur Andrew Mason poured his
                own money into the GPS audio walking tour company <a href="https://www.detour.com/">Detour</a>. Unlike
                the artists and musicians before him, he had commercial ambition. He hired some of the best radio
                producers in the industry, and set about making highly-crafted documentary-style walks all around the
                world, partnering with companies such as Airbnb, RadioLab and SXSW. And he charged. At first, you could
                buy walks individually for $5 or $10. Later, this expanded to bundles of walks. You could sync your walk
                with your friends and do the walk in groups. The idea was that, in the end, the public would take over
                the platform and create their own Detours.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/533/1*KWg70AyIYF4Xd6gvgn59DQ.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>But Detour highlighted geo-located audio’s main disadvantage: reach. To experience Mason’s walks you had
                to be on location, and compared to the mass audience online this meant the potential audience was small.
                After three years, Detour closed. Mason has since turned his attention to <a
                    href="http://www.hackneyhear.com/">Descript</a>, the software system built for Detour which allows
                you to edit sound by working directly with the transcript.</p>
            <p>It’s possible that Detour, like many of us, was just ahead of its time.</p>
            <p>Right now, many of locative audio’s constituent parts are either fashionable or downright popular.
                Podcasting has finally taken off. Google and Amazon are investing in “Voice” — i.e., Siri, Alexa and
                that ilk. And if you pair these voice assistants with “hearables” (smart ear buds) you have the
                potential for augmented reality to take off.</p>
            <p>Bose has serious ambitions for the <a
                    href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/wearables/frames.html?mc=25_PS_FR_BO_DT_GO_&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiArqPgBRCRARIsAPwlHoWZsHq4pwnYJJiMee9P_Da0-CD8kTRGV3wRM9BVrCwuCAZnPv5rtVAaAhs4EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Frames</a>
                they have just launched. They are hearables in sunglasses form, but, in fact, the glasses part is a bit
                of a red herring. There is nothing visually augmented. They are just holders for little speakers which
                sit just above your ears but not over or in them, so you can hear the sounds of the real world around
                you too.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/485/1*rP49gWsLK-1emoloFFWoTQ.png"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>They also contain a small motor sensor (IMU) and bluetooth receiver, which means if synced with the Bose
                app on your phone, the combined system can track your GPS coordinates as well as your head movements.
                This means the locative audio can now, in theory, be accurate, specific, and three-dimensional—a far cry
                from the tech I was working with back in 2011.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, Bose announced a $50 million investment fund to support startups that are developing
                applications for the new platform. Currently, the company is branding Frames as “sunglasses with a
                soundtrack,” but the press release states that “music is just the beginning.” Coming soon will be a
                software update that includes applications for fitness, travel, and games.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/533/1*vRxBzUq35twwSv4vaM9PkQ.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>Sennheiser also has an Immersive Audio program called <a
                    href="https://en-us.sennheiser.com/finalstop">AMBEO</a>. However, the company seems to have little
                ambition to build in head-tracking or GPS capabilities. Instead, Sennheiser focuses on making 3D
                recording easy for anyone—for example, building binaural microphones into headsets so you can both
                listen and record. Sennheiser is also developing headsets which allow you to bleed in as much of the
                outside world as you want, especially for AR applications.</p>
            <p>All in all, “Audio AR” seems to have gathered some momentum, and, compared to visual AR and VR, the
                technical barriers seem marginal. With the integration of the Voice technologies, you can imagine audio
                AR being used pretty easily, perhaps not as glasses but as sensor-equipped headphones or earbuds.</p>
            <p>For makers, these technologies open up new creative possibilities. Head tracking means you can make
                dynamic spatialized audio. Whereas previously the sounds were “fixed” on your ears, now you can place
                your sounds in space around you.</p>

            <p>And, for me, the development of “Audio AR” has resparked my enthusiasm for locative audio. I’m
                relistening to Janet Cardiff and again dreaming up projects which allow us as storytellers to intervene
                through audio in these spaces.</p>
