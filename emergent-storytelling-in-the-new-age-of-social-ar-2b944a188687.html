            <h3 id="ed70">Hacking SparkAR and Lens Studio as AR tools that go beyond the typical selfie filter</h3>
            <p><em>This article has been researched and developed at the MIT Open DocLab with Alex Herrero, a fellow
                    from the MIT Summer Research Program.</em></p>
            <p>Throughout the past decade, extensive <a
                    href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691168340/coming-of-age-in-second-life">scholarship</a>,
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t89fZ0RqEw&amp;ab_channel=jasonskoff">documentaries</a>, and
                <a href="http://www.digiart21.org/art/kool-aid-man-in-second-life">experimental pieces</a> in
                multiplayer worlds such as Second Life interrogated the fluid boundaries between virtual and real
                worlds. Since games like PokemonGO revolutionized location-based AR in 2016 and VRChat sparked a major
                VR-maker community in 2018, popular awareness of virtual worlds have grown alongside the powerful social
                communities co-created by its users.
            </p>
            <p>With major social media giants scaling XR, we are now approaching a new era of augmented social space.
                Facebook is in its beta stage of Facebook Horizon, a massive-multiplayer VR world, while Snapchat and
                Instagram are offering new platforms that make Augmented Reality filters and machine-learning features
                increasingly accessible. On one end of the spectrum, this reads as a nightmare for user agency, with our
                personal data and online social spaces increasingly co-opted as a marketplace for advertisers. On the
                other end, social XR bypasses some issues of accessibility that have marked the XR industry. How should
                nonfiction storytellers reconceptualize these changes to best use platforms for their own creative ends?
            </p>
            <p>One potential way forward is within AR, where Lens Studio and SparkAR have been embraced by the creative
                community since becoming publicly available last year. AR allows people with no coding background to
                create filters and share them on Instagram and Snapchat for anyone to use, becoming a household tool
                overnight. While many of the use cases remain surface-level interventions, such as hamster faces,
                cosmetic filters, and branding schemes, there’s also unprecedented user-generated creativity.</p>
            <p>Since 2010, artists have used AR as a political intervention, like in <a
                    href="https://docubase.mit.edu/project/ar-occupy-wall-street/">AR Occupy Wall Street</a>, as well as
                critical <a href="http://www.sndrv.nl/moma/?page=details">“art invasions” at institutions such as
                    MoMA</a>. In tandem, we’ve seen a growing tradition of making public AR art more accessible, such
                as<a href="https://www.4thwallapp.org/"> Nancy Baker Cahill’s work with 4th wall</a> and the growth of
                AR installations with <a href="https://www.newmuseum.org/pages/view/ar-t">unique sponsorships by both
                    private and public institutions</a>. With Lens Studio and Spark AR, AR creation and distribution
                merge in social media, requiring creators to recalibrate the landscape altogether.</p>
            <h2 id="40fe"><strong>Here are some examples, strategies, and ways forward for thinking about Social AR for
                    documentary storytelling:</strong></h2>
            <h3 id="c212"><strong>Telling stories with the users</strong></h3>
            <p>In social AR, the story is not about the specific filter but the user-generated content it provokes. For
                instance, an Instagram filter that simulates an aesthetic of analog film <a
                    href="https://medium.com/lens-studio/emotion-explored-in-ar-b9a89ed6f4c1">layers the emotion of
                    nostalgia</a> to visual culture to affect the lens from which we see things, perhaps creating
                “virtual worlds” of its own. AR takes things further by allowing interaction not only with the image,
                but more crucially with the user’s movements and their environment.</p>

            <p>For political advocacy campaigns, AR creators can utilize the virality of interactivity as a tool to
                engage communities at a mass scale. In 2017, the UN and creative agency VML <a
                    href="https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/united-nations-notatarget-vml-new-york/1442516">released
                    a campaign for World Humanitarian Day</a>, in which SparkAR was used for individuals to read aloud
                the stories of those affected by conflict. More recently, many activists took to AR <a
                    href="https://www.kaceydilla.com/virtual-reality/inspiring-ar-supporting-the-black-lives-matter-movement/">to
                    push forward the Black Lives Matter movement</a>, creating filters that overlay streets and <a
                    href="https://www.insider.com/influencers-promote-black-lives-matter-donation-instagram-ar-filter-2020-6">gamify
                    donations</a>.</p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/jack_merrell/status/1271175402329866241&amp;image="
                    width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
            <p>Such techniques, of course, run the risk of relying on proprietary software to affect change and in many
                ways use the same tactics as branded content. Coupled with other avenues for deeper, sustained
                engagement, however, such campaigns are a good starting point to mobilize direct action. This new form
                of user-generated content will be important to consider for future forms of nonfiction storytelling.</p>
            <h3 id="5443"><strong>Hacking the app for unconventional uses</strong></h3>

            <p>The documentary tradition is marked by creators “hijacking” conventional tools for innovative purposes.
                If creators aren’t too keen on orchestrating mass media campaigns, other strategic uses of social AR can
                offer opportunities for meaningful storytelling. In <a

                    Realities</a>, users use Snapchat to overlay objects like a 3D-captured tent onto their own physical
                environment, while hearing the stories of homeless individuals. <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prnic9HsZ10">To do this</a>, the creators needed to adapt the
                size of their 3D assets to fall within Snapchat’s specs but in return were able to share the project
                without requiring viewers to download a custom app.</p>

            <p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/80724755/Grey-Matter-AR">Grey Matter AR</a> describes
                itself as a documentary “hiding” inside of Snapchat. This experience shares stories of 10 senior
                citizens in Canada. The collection of 50 15-second scenes brings younger generations who use Snapchat in
                dialogue with their elders. Such projects gesture towards the possibility of subvert a culture of flower
                crowns filters. As artist <a
                    href="https://www.cbc.ca/arts/this-ar-documentary-is-hiding-inside-snapchat-1.5082806">Karen
                    Vanderborght expresses</a> in this CBC blog, “That’s my artist practice, basically, to use tools and
                then tell stories with them, even if they’re not necessarily developed specifically for that. It’s a way
                of dropping in what I hope is meaningful content in a very superficial sphere.”</p>
            <p>Another notable example is how National Geographic used SparkAR to project climate change data while
                visualizing the globe in 2070. Part of their April Earth Day issue, this project is an intervention in
                the social media space while also connecting users to a digital issue of the magazine.</p>

            <h3 id="5f67"><strong>Build community with XR creators and enthusiasts, generating interest in new
                    skills</strong></h3>
            <p>For many who aren’t already seeped in the XR industry, online creative communities have been essential to
                maintaining an artistic practice. For instance, the <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SparkARcommunity">SparkAR Community Group</a> has over 75,000
                users who frequently share artworks and tips with one another. Some creators <a
                    href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20963747/ommy-akhe-instagram-filters-spark-ar-augmented-reality">report
                    this community as a useful entry-point into AR</a> and a major reason to pursue the medium.
                Moreover, SparkAR and Lens Studio offer creators access to statistics for their AR projects, such as the
                amount of views, shares, and the number of pictures and videos taken with the effect. When creators see
                their filters reaching millions of users and the resultant creativity, this activity can in turn inspire
                new works.</p>
            <h3 id="fd27"><strong>Looking forward to independent and democratized distribution</strong></h3>
            <p>SparkAR and Lens Studio require an approval process from Facebook and Snapchat’s content moderators,
                running risks of moderation biases that limit creators’ agency. Recently, SparkAR publishing has been
                delayed because COVID-19 <a
                    href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/publishing/the-spark-ar-approval-process/">halted
                    the ability</a> to make site-specific content approvals on Facebook’s campuses. Moreover, while
                these platforms make statistics available to the creators, the implications of how Facebook collects big
                data in their AR tools are up for question.</p>
            <p>While riding the hype of social AR, it’s important to recognize that browser-based AR can obliterate the
                need for app-based AR, replacing SparkAR and Lens Studio. Current developments such as <a
                    href="https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js">AR.js</a>, an open-source framework, and <a
                    href="https://www.8thwall.com/">8th wall</a>, an emerging software, gesture towards this future but
                still are in nascent stages. WebAR will allow even more creative liberty through an open-source
                infrastructure, and allow people to share content as long as they can enable their web browser to access
                their device’s camera.</p>
            <p>Moreover, experienced developers will find limitations in social AR platforms for making more complex
                graphics and interactions. In this case, <a href="https://unity.com/unity/features/arfoundation">AR
                    Foundation</a> is a tool for creating AR in Unity without facing the usual problem with
                cross-platform integration. Similar tools also have robust creative communities that are useful for
                developing creators’ coding skill sets and finding collaborators.</p>
            <p>As more people are opting out of social media in search of alternate modes of social connectivity, tools
                such as AR Foundation and web AR will be useful for building digital infrastructures that are more
                independent from big tech corporations. Doing so offers more data privacy and creative freedom in the
                construction of new, virtual worlds.</p>
