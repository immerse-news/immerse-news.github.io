                <p>— Joshua Breitbart, Senior Advisor for Broadband at the Office of the Mayor, New York City</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>A prelude to the </strong><em><strong>Making a New Reality series</strong></em></p>
            <p>In 2008 my life took a turn from the world of live performing arts and tangible visual arts to an
                increasingly more virtual engagement with arts and creativity. I went from a primarily analog world to a
                primarily digital one in a period of rapid innovation and fundamental changes to the human communication
                architecture. This personal journey has informed a long-form research project that I’ve been conducting
                with support from the Ford Foundation’s JustFilms program and will be publishing in the pages of
                <em>Immerse</em> over the next several months.
            </p>
            <p>The JustFilm’s commission enabled me to intensively listen to a host of voices answering the questions:
                <em>How do we provide robust support for those working to further equality through emerging media?</em>
                and<strong> </strong><em>How do we ensure equality in the industries of emerging media?</em>
            </p>
            <h3 id="06d3"><strong>Transforming alongside the world</strong></h3>
            <p>As a long-time cast member of an Off-Broadway show, the owner and artistic director of a dance theater
                company, a teaching artist, and a strategist for one of the largest traditional art campuses in the
                country, the transition into the primarily tech-driven environment of emerging media made me feel like
                Alice falling down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. First, I became a producer and artist on a landmark
                transmedia art project archived at the Smithsonian, then a producer for the top transmedia production
                studio in Hollywood, then the director of the New Frontier Lab Programs at the Sundance Institute.</p>
            <p>It was a huge adjustment to be the outsider turned insider, and not just because I transitioned from
                engaging with some of the oldest art forms to some of the newest, but because I have an intersection of
                identity backgrounds that are not well represented in Silicon Valley, Hollywood, gaming or corporate
                America (some of the fields that converge in emerging media). As an insider, I’ve noticed a lot of
                details that seem curious, both in the awesome and fearsome sense of the word. Now, in 2017, I can tell
                the story of a woman of color, social justice advocate and single mother of three who stands near the
                epicenter of a media paradigm shift and has a front row seat to the process of power replicating itself.
            </p>
            <p>It has been a cherished and privileged journey, but also a disturbing one that has shaken my core. I’ve
                been witness to the pitfalls of new technologies born into systems of oppression that caused me to
                deeply question the possibility that justice and equality could ultimately prevail — though there have
                also been profound moments where small interventions made a significant impact on furthering inclusion
                and fair distribution of power.</p>
            <h3 id="d568"><strong>Furthering equality through media</strong></h3>
            <p>Over the 80-plus years of its history, the the Ford Foundation has made catalyzing interventions in
                media, including establishing the framework and seed resources for public television in the United
                States, and supporting the rise of the independent media field, including the field of independent
                documentaries. Currently, Ford Foundation’s JustFilms initiative has a robust history of funding moving
                image media makers and the organizations that support them in seeking to reduce inequality in all of its
                forms through social justice storytelling. As part of the Creativity and Free Expression Program,
                JustFilms supports projects, organizations and networks working across film, and increasingly in
                emerging media, that inspire imaginations, challenge stereotypes, and help transform the conditions that
                perpetuate injustice.</p>
            <p>Seeing the new story technologies emerging and being applied to social justice issues, Cara Mertes, the
                Director of the JustFilms program, commissioned this global field scan and analysis to identify the
                kinds of interventions that might tip the scales of emerging media toward justice and equality.</p>
            <p>Through a series of eight articles over eight months, <em>Immerse</em> will publish the results of the
                <em>Making a New Reality </em>research project. Each post will provide a summary of major findings with
                links to detailed segments of the research. What this research makes clear is that the scale of
                disruption in creative media making, distribution and moving image storytelling will touch every aspect
                of the way societies are organized. The goal is to help Ford Foundation, as well as its grantees, peer
                philanthropy organizations, and the greater community of changemakers better navigate disruption on a
                scale seen only once a century.
            </p>
            <p>Ultimately, I hope this series will fuel a broad-based and vigorous discussion, as well as informing
                actionable, critical interventions that can improve equity and inclusion in emerging media and ensure
                that a broader set of stories are influencing our collective vision of the future. This is our
                challenge.</p>
            <h3 id="e6b6"><strong>Interventions for equity</strong></h3>
            <p>The thought leaders I interviewed had varying ideas for interventions that, as interviewee Jennifer
                Arceneaux observed, fall into four focus areas:</p>
            <p><strong>Industry — direct interventions in the tech, gaming, film, and bio-media industries</strong></p>
            <p>The goal of these interventions is to disrupt the centers of power to ensure that diverse voices are
                included and represented at every level of these industries.</p>
            <p><em>Strategies include:</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating an impact investing fund that would focus on supporting social entrepreneurs from the
                    creative sector, with a special priority for traditionally underrepresented voices.</li>
                <li>Mitigating the wealth gap and high barriers to entry.</li>
                <li>Advocating for funding programs that embed diverse artists into the think tanks and councils forming
                    to design the “rules” for integrating emerging tech and media into our societal infrastructure</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Education—interventions focused on educating the citizenry, through the formal education system,
                    professional development programs, and community programs</strong></p>
            <p>The goal of these interventions is to disrupt the power imbalance that exists between code-literate and
                code-illiterate communities, in terms of designing human-centered futures and equitable economic
                systems.</p>
            <p><em>Strategies include:</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increasing STEAM curriculum</li>
                <li>Teaching ethical design practices</li>
                <li>Supporting code/tech literacy programs in traditionally oppressed or under-resourced communities.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Public Space and Policy — Interventions focused on circumventing the commercial marketplace by
                    creating a public or noncommercial emerging media ecosystem that can be competitive with for-profit
                    platforms for audience engagement</strong></p>
            <p>The goal of these interventions is to develop approaches to media distribution that are decentralized and
                diverse, while building a brand that can incorporate multiple content types and attract audiences.</p>
            <p><em>Strategies include:</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Building inclusive interdisciplinary communities outside of industry power-centers</li>
                <li>Publicly funding creative workforce development initiatives</li>
                <li>Creating policies that break echo chambers in media</li>
                <li>Maintaining net neutrality protecting privacy</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Shifting Attitudes — interventions into the consciousness of people through strategies that
                    mitigate bias.</strong></p>
            <p>The goal of these interventions is to encourage equality by helping people learn to mitigate their own
                negative biases about others and themselves.</p>
            <p><em>Strategies include:</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Advocating for creating safe spaces</li>
                <li>Adjusting the center of design — building media infrastructure and tech innovation that centers the
                    imaginations and value systems of traditionally marginalized people</li>
                <li>Breaking the innovator stereotype by amplifying diverse innovators</li>
                <li>Disrupting dependency narratives and rigid bias narratives</li>
                <li>Expanding identity literacy</li>
                <li>Bridging the gaps between art, science and technology cultures</li>
            </ul>
