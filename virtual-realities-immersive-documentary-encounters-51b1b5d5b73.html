        <section>
            <p><em>by Mandy Rose</em></p>
            <p>When the Oculus Rift Developer kit was launched in 2013, few people anticipated that nonfiction would
                rapidly become a prime theme within VR production — so that by 2015 VR projects were being commissioned
                by organizations including the BBC, the <em>New York Times</em> and the UN, and extravagant claims were
                being made by producer Chris Milk for VR as “the ultimate empathy machine.” As a researcher looking at
                emerging documentary practices, this was a field that called for investigation. I started talking to
                fellow researchers Ki Cater from the University of Bristol and Danae Stanton Fraser from the University
                of Bath about what a project interrogating VR nonfiction might look like.</p>
            <p>Bringing together discourses from documentary and journalism, development processes from filmmaking and
                video games, and a platform that had already been widely studied for its potential in educational,
                military and clinical contexts, we were convinced that this emerging medium needed an interdisciplinary
                research approach. So, we began to consider how we might combine Ki’s expertise in computer science,
                Danae’s research in psychology, and my own perspective in documentary studies. In 2016 the UK’s
                Engineering &amp; Physical Sciences Research Council announced a funding call for projects concerned
                with content creation in the digital economy. After submitting a successful Expression of Interest, we
                went to the second round, and, in 2017, the project was selected from a shortlist of over a hundred
                projects.</p>
            <p>So, thirty years after the term virtual reality was coined, and nearly fifty years since Ivan
                Sutherland’s first experiments with a “head mounted three dimensional display,” we embarked on <em><a
                        href="http://vrdocumentaryencounters.co.uk/">Virtual Realities: Immersive Documentary
                        Encounters</a></em>, to explore the application of VR to nonfiction.</p>
            <p>We began with the hypothesis that the spatial environment of VR might have significant potential for
                nonfiction, but that immersive environments would also give rise to new challenges for documentary. Our
                primary research question is broad — asking how the affordances of VR for immersion and interaction
                might take forward documentary’s mission for storytelling about our shared world. To answer that
                question we are looking at what spatial storytelling within virtual environments contributes to the work
                of documentary for witnessing “the real.” How might the feeling of being there, known as “presence,”
                contribute to a knowledge of and engagement with the people and situations reflected within virtual
                environments? How do different VR platforms and their associated sociality and isolation mediate VR
                documentary experiences?</p>
            <p>We are also interested in the production process — and are looking at the challenges of designing a
                shared grammar of VR experiences involving real-life subject matter with an interdisciplinary mix of
                stakeholders. Additionally, we are probing the ethical implications of virtual encounters with images of
                real people and places. Finally, we are asking: What business models are emerging to support VR
                documentary production?</p>
            <p>The research is unfolding through a number of work packages that address our research questions from a
                number of directions. We’ve been mapping all the English language nonfiction VR created between 2012 and
                2018 in an online interactive form to reveal the extent of this sector, as well as themes, technology
                platforms and storytelling approaches. Meanwhile, we’ve been undertaking a number of empirical studies —
                looking at audience responses to VR nonfiction — both in the lab and “in the wild.”</p>
            <p>At the same time, we’ve commissioned three path-finding VR pieces. In <em>Waiting Room: VR</em>, Victoria
                Mapplebeck has taken her experience of breast cancer treatment as a theme through which to explore how
                she might translate her first-person documentary approach into 360 video. In <em>Love &amp;
                    Seawater</em>, Lisa Harewood and Ewan Cass- Kavanagh investigate what VR might contribute to the
                <em>Barrel Stories</em> project — a multi-faceted exploration of the legacy of family separation within
                economic migration to the UK from the Caribbean. In <em>Transplant</em>, Oscar Raby and Katy Morrison
                return to the Pinochet regime in Chile — the historical terrain of Oscar’s first VR work,
                <em>Assent</em>, to develop the formal question at the heart of that piece: how story can be conveyed
                through interaction. Through a series of in-depth interviews, we’re examining these three commissions as
                case studies. Finally, we’ll be looking at the economy of VR nonfiction through a production study of
                ten companies.

            <p>A number of partnerships underpin the research. Among them we are working with BBC R&amp;D. Maxine Glancy
                from that team has been at the heart of the project, contributing a creative industries perspective.
                Other partners — the <em>Guardian</em> VR team, for instance — have joined us in a series of workshops
                through which we’re in dialogue about the research with a wider group of academics and makers. Our third
                workshop, <em>Changing Minds — on the Ethics of VR Nonfiction</em> — will take place at the BBC in
                November.</p>
            <p>We now have a huge amount of data to analyse and some remaining research still to undertake, but we have
                lots to share and we’re keen to disseminate our work. Over the coming months we’ll be sharing our work
                in a series of articles for <em>Immerse, </em>as well as taking papers to academic conferences and
                publishing in journals. In the first article, published in this issue of <em>Immerse</em>, Dr. Harry
                Farmer describes our research into <a

                    power of nonfiction VR to change attitudes and reduce prejudice</a>. In later issues, we will also
                be presenting pieces on our research into audience responses to nonfiction VR “in the wild” and our work
                in cataloguing and analysing the trends in nonfiction VR production over the past 5 years.</p>
            <p>The intention of the research is to offer critical support to the development of this production sector,
                while keeping the interests of the audience and the documentary subjects to the fore. We hope these
                articles will contribute to that project.</p>
