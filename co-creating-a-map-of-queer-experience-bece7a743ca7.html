            <p><em>Lucas LaRochelle is a multidisciplinary designer and researcher examining queerness, technology, and
                    architecture. Their practice explores interactions between the body, technology, and space. MIT Open
                    Documentary Lab director Sarah Wolozin interviewed them about their project </em><a
                    href="https://www.queeringthemap.com/">Queering The Map</a><em>. Highlights from the interview were
                    included in the </em>Collective Wisdom<em> report, but here we present a more in-depth look at
                    Lucas’s approach to this project. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>

            <h3 id="cd94">What is Queering the Map?</h3>
            <p><em>Queering the Map</em> is a community-generated counter-mapping project that digitally chronicles
                queer experience in relation to physical space. The project collaboratively records queer life to
                preserve our histories and unfolding realities, which continue to be invalidated, contested, and erased.
                From collective action to stories of coming out, encounters with violence to moments of rapturous love,
                <em>Queering the Map</em> functions as a living archive of queer experience. Currently, it’s home to
                over 80 000 stories in 23 languages, from across the world.
            </p>

            <h3 id="d893">Do you consider this project co-creative?</h3>
            <p>Definitely. My practice often engages in co-creative methods because I’m wary of individual authorship.
                Nothing exists in a vacuum — ultimately all ideas are the result of co-creation. I consider <em>Queering
                    The Map</em> to be a co-creative archive. It is open to whomever has access to it and is interested
                in contributing to it. Posts are not curated (though they are moderated for hate, spam, and unsafe
                content) and the result is something that is fundamentally messy, contradictory, and confusing.</p>
            <p><em>Queering the Map</em> emerged from my interest in thinking about how space informs my understanding
                of my own queer experience. I recognize that my experience is one of privilege. I am white, able-bodied,
                and of a middle-class background — which is why a co-creative practice is so critical, as it facilitates
                a way to decenter myself and mobilize my privilege in order to benefit my community.</p>

                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"

            <h3 id="f819">How do you co-create with people online?</h3>
            <p>For me, it’s been about building and maintaining a framework that enables co-creative storytelling. I
                would consider myself a facilitator. I have set up an infrastructure with which to co-create a digital
                archive of queer life. The opportunity to add to and complexify the contents of the archive is open to
                anyone who has access to the site.</p>
            <p>Collaborative coding tools like GitHub are also instrumental to the co-creative practice, as they allow
                for a wider range of input outside of my geographic context. Currently, <em>Queering The Map</em>’s
                GitHub repository is private, though making the base code public and open-source is part of the future
                development of the project.</p>
            <p>While digital networks greatly increase the possibilities for co-creating, the transnational world of
                <em>Queering The Map</em>,—having an online-only archive— excludes those who do not have access to the
                internet. So, it is of course not without its limitations.
            </p>
            <h3 id="1297">What happened when the project quickly rose in popularity?</h3>
            <p>Within a period of three days in February 2018, it went from 300 shares to just over 10,000 shares on
                Facebook alone, which increased the number of points added from 600 to about 6,500. At first, they were
                mostly in North America and a few in Australia, but they quickly spread across every continent.</p>
            <p>Following that three-day period, the project was spammed by Trump supporters, who injected malicious
                javascript code into the site that generated pop-ups reading “Donald Trump Best President” and “Make
                America Great Again.” I took the map down, and put out a call for help on the URL. Thankfully, because
                it had already generated so much attention, I received dozens of emails along the lines of “We’re queer
                coders and we love this project. How can we help get it back online?” Some of them set up a GitHub, and
                from there it was about a two-month process of working collaboratively to get it back online in a manner
                that was far more sustainable. Notably, a moderation system was developed so that hateful content could
                be controlled.</p>
            <p>This development took <em>Queering the Map</em> from existing as a participatory project — in terms of me
                having the ultimate control over its infrastructure in the beginning — to a truly co-creative one. What
                was ultimately a prototype was put out into the community, who then identified its importance and helped
                to collaboratively re-construct it. This method of working is risky, but the payoff has been immense.
            </p>
            <h3 id="ba86">What are your broader goals with this project?</h3>
            <p>I first encountered other queer people in virtual spaces — encounters that were not available to me in
                rural Ontario. It is not an overstatement to say that these digital spaces saved my life. My overall
                intention with this project is to contribute to the life-sustaining force that is queer internet
                culture, to hold digital space for queer communities across the world.</p>
            <p>One of <em>Queering the Map</em>’s goals is to contribute to discourses that think of queer space beyond
                places of consumption like bars, nightclubs, bookstores, bathhouses. As the proliferation of digital
                technologies radically reshapes the ways in which LGBTQ2+ folks access and create community,
                <em>Queering The Map</em> works to archive these otherwise ephemeral queer spaces. A fleeting glance of
                queer recognition, a T shot in a library bathroom, an MSN conversation with an anonymous online lover —
                these moments are themselves places of refuge.
            </p>
            <p>The project aims to move away from thinking on queer space as fixed, and towards an approach to queer
                spacemaking that is rooted in action, as responsive and in flux. A queer approach to space understands
                that we cannot <em>be</em> queer in a fixed sense, but rather that we are <em>doing</em> queer through
                acts of resistance. To move away from the notion of a queer space as immovable, as settled — and rather
                to think of queer space as something rooted in the continuous breaking down of cis-heteropatriarchal,
                white supremacist, colonial, classist and ableist structures. This shift makes necessary a sustained
                engagement with the histories and presents of a place and its shifting political context.</p>
