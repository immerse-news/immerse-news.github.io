            <p>The theme for this issue of <em>Immerse</em> is “playing with reality.” As we’ve been assembling it, I’ve
                been thinking about how working on the publication inspired me to create my own game—and how that in
                turn opened my eyes to an entire genre of card games designed to inform real-world media strategy.</p>
            <p>Over the past five years, I’ve collaborated with Carrie McLaren—who is also part of the <em>Immerse</em>
                editorial collective—to create and evolve a strategy deck called the <a
                    href="https://dotconnectorstudio.com/cards/">Impact Pack</a>. The deck is designed to help media
                makers, funders, and producers map out a project or campaign, with an eye towards understanding
                different models for engaging audience members and generating social impact. In funder jargon, we call
                it a “theory of change builder” — it allows players to think through which platforms they’re using, who
                they are targeting, how they will engage stakeholders, and what the outcomes might be.</p>
            <p>Initially, these were all positive outcomes, a hopeful formulation: behavior change, political change,
                empowerment, increased trust. But last year we added a new suit: “Unintended Outcomes.” This allows
                players to contemplate how even their best intentions might go awry, spurring addiction, narcissism,
                bullying, depression, and more. This seemed especially crucial in an era of social media and
                misinformation</p>
            <p>The deck can be used for project planning up front or mid-stream, for evaluating an existing project, or
                just to unstick your brain and noodle with possibilities. We update it regularly to reflect the changing
                landscape of media platforms and issues. There’s a suit called “Senses” that’s designed especially for
                makers who are pushing the boundaries of experiential media. In addition to sight, sound, taste, smell,
                and touch, users can choose to incorporate a card called “the sixth sense,” and riff on what that might
                be: a sense of humor, a sense of the body in space, a sense of urgency.</p>
            <p>Over the years, the deck has travelled <a
                    href="https://dotconnectorstudio.com/on-the-trail-of-the-impact-pack/">around the globe</a> to
                festivals, classrooms, and media outlets—Greenpeace International adopted it for their digital
                trainings, the <a href="https://www.solutionsjournalism.org/">Solutions Journalism Network</a> took it
                to sessions in Africa and Latin America, policymakers in Budapest used it to think through media
                development for different countries. Users love the tactile experience of the physical deck, the
                meditative act of laying out a strategy step-by-step, and thinking through the arc of a project. But
                when the pandemic hit, our printer went dark for awhile, and we could no longer host in-person
                workshops. So we created a digital version, which has also proven to be useful for our clients and in
                educational settings. <a href="https://dotconnectorstudio.com/contactus/">Drop us a line</a> if you’d

            <p>In the course of developing the Impact Pack, we’ve discovered the unexpectedly bustling world of strategy
                decks for creative professionals. There are decks for <a href="https://sixwaypoints.com/">dreaming up
                    startups</a>, planning <a href="https://groupworksdeck.org/">thoughtful convenings</a>, mapping out

                and many more.
            </p>
            <p>Here are just a few of the decks I’ve collected over the years that are designed for storytellers,
                designers, and journalists. Some are still available, some have gone dark—like the media industry
                itself, the marketplace for these card games is tenuous and ever-changing.</p>

            <p><strong>The Art of Game Design</strong></p>
            <p>What better way is there to learn how to create a game than to play one? <a
                    href="https://www.schellgames.com/art-of-game-design/">This deck</a>, designed by Jesse Schell—a
                professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center and the CEO of Schell Games—offers
                players various “lenses” through which they can understand different aspects of game design. There are
                cards addressing mechanics, aesthetics, psychology, play-testing, and business. Each one includes a key
                principle and related questions. A companion book provides guidance on developing games for VR and AR.

            <p><strong>The Shadow World</strong></p>
            <p>This <a href="https://www.laurenceking.com/product/the-shadow-world/">intriguing game</a> for
                storyscaping science fiction narratives is illustrated by Shan Jiang, who also co-designs these <a
                    href="https://pigchickencow.com/shop">amazing scarves</a>. Entirely visual, it is based on Victorian
                card games called “myrioramas” that allow players to lay out cleverly interconnecting illustrations in
                any order to build a visual narrative. In this deck a set of adjoining tubes lead players through
                underground and underwater tunnels, labs, and lairs, featuring monsters, robots, adventurers, and — for
                some reason—a zebra lit by a full moon. Players can lay out their own stories, work together to create
                joint narratives, or create dueling tales. I found the game mechanics fascinating, but for me it also
                brought up the limitations of the genre: while the male characters get to be scientists, explorers, and
                bounty hunters, female characters include “the wife-bot” and “the witch.”</p>

            <p><strong>Aha! The Ideation Game for Journalism Innovation</strong></p>
            <p>Nicholas Diakopoulos — now an associate professor at Northwestern’s School of Communication, where he
                directs the <a href="https://cj-lab.org/">Computational Journalism Lab </a>— designed this deck. It
                emerged from a research project that he conducted for CUNY’s <a
                    href="https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/centers/tow-knight-center-entrepreneurial-journalism/">Tow-Knight
                    Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism</a>. The deck is divided into three color-coded suits:
                “Technology,” “Consumer Needs,” and “Journalistic Goals.” Players get one card from each suit, and then
                are challenged to invent a journalistic product or service and a related use case. After a few rounds,
                they present their best idea to the larger group. This deck was last updated in 2016 and looks to have
                gone out of circulation. To get a sense of how it worked in practice, see this <a

            <p>For a more contemplative experience, <a href="http://jenniferelsner.com/about-oracle/">this deck</a>
                offers users the chance to select a card or lay out a spread in order to meditate upon the relationship
                between designer and client. Each of the 50 cards is marked with a colored dot, and contains an insight
                (examples: “Embody Ouroboros” or “Utilize Hyperbole” ) along with related instructions for finding
                meaning.</p>
            <p>The deck is part of a larger set of projects by designer Jennifer Eisner, who rather hilariously <a
                    href="https://www.humans-like-you.com/jennifer">explains</a>:</p>
            <p>“My artist practice is a critique of my professional practice. It’s a decades-long performance piece.
                ORA+CLE is the most recent in a series of projects titled: <em>The Cantos</em>. A reckoning of past
                work, behaviors, and clients. <em>The Cantos: 1</em> was a 2-month long, daily written response to a
                6,000 mile journey on a 40′ scroll. <em>The Cantos: 2</em> was the burning of this scroll and the ashes
                used to bake a cake I ate. <em>The Cantos: 3</em> was a month-long, live-streamed reading of 2,000 pages
                of email, representing nine months of digital communication — from the initial courting through the
                final threat of a lawsuit. ORA+CLE is <em>The Cantos: 4</em>. And <em>The Cantos: 5</em> will be a
                future performance where I’ll ritualistically strangle a client’s emails with zip cords.”</p>
