            <h3 id="2ee3">A conversation with authors Helen De Michiel and Patricia R. Zimmermann</h3>
            <p><em>I first met Patricia R. Zimmermann in 2004 when I was a visiting assistant professor at Ithaca
                    College. Through her, I met many independent filmmakers, including Helen De Michiel, who was also
                    the co-director of the National Alliance for Media Arts &amp; Culture (NAMAC). One of my fondest
                    memories of the two of them was going to the 5th Congreso Internacional de Teoría y Análisis
                    Cinematográfico in Morelia (Michoacán), México, in 2009. Patty and Helen delivered a plenary talk,
                    “The Open Space Documentary Project,” on digital documentary practice that emphasized the
                    documentarian’s role in providing context as well as content.</em></p>

            </figure>
            <p><em>Many of the ideas in that talk developed into their new book, </em><a
                    href="http://Open Space New Media Documentary: A Toolkit for T…">Open Space New Media Documentary: A
                    Toolkit for Theory and Practice</a><em> (Routledge, 2018), which I read early this summer and have
                    more recently had the opportunity to discuss with them. The book is remarkable because it integrates
                    documentary studies with documentary practice. They don’t fixate on formal elements or devices but
                    instead get into how different forms can help articulate new perspectives around particular issues.
                    In the process, they highlight place-based practices that mobilize new media to reinvigorate, if not
                    outright reinvent, documentary.</em></p>
            <p><em>Most of us are familiar with documentary through the old media practices of analog film and
                    television. As audiences, we sit, watch, and listen as documentarians carefully compose narratives
                    and arguments for us. New media adds other features, such as the possibility for us as audience
                    members to become collaborators by reordering these narratives and arguments. We can engage in
                    comparative analysis. We can tease out intricacies. Narratives and arguments are not fixed on
                    celluloid and magnetic tape; instead, they are rendered on screen through user acts, such as
                    clicking icons. Documentary is no longer static, but fluid.</em></p>
            <p><em>Patty and Helen take this re-conception of documentary one step further by considering projects that
                    advocate for “open space,” which is a concept used in urban planning and other fields to suggest
                    commons—that is, spaces that have not been privatized or militarized, ones that anyone can
                    theoretically access, utilize, and inhabit. To make a long-form documentary and then get it
                    exhibited requires a level of resources and support that is out of reach for most of us. Commons
                    open up new possibilities.</em></p>
            <p><em>Taking advantage of available digital tools and circulation options, the open space new media
                    documentaries that Patty and Helen describe provoke and encourage other perspectives to be seen,
                    heard, and understood. These project move across analog, digital, and embodied settings to where
                    people and technologies meet. They move out of cinemas, broadcast, cable, and satellite into
                    everyday public gathering spaces— art and community centers, schools, libraries, hospitals—and onto
                    mobile phones. They work towards a practice of discovery.</em></p>
            <p><strong>Dale: When did you begin to notice a critical mass of what you are defining as “open space new
                    media” projects that helped you redefine documentary?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Patty</strong>:<strong> </strong>These collaborative works require a different and new
                theorization of the documentary project because they shift virtually all the coordinates.</p>
            <p>Our thinking about open space new media documentary began a decade ago. As co-director of the Finger
                Lakes Environmental Film Festival (FLEFF) over the last 15 years, which programs across platforms, I
                observed a dramatic shift in documentary from fixed, closed forms toward more iterative, shape-shifting,
                multi-platformed projects. (And kudos to you, Dale, who as our new media curator found some of the
                projects in the book.)</p>
            <p>Although we always program analog films, I witnessed a tectonic shift into a more horizontal, distributed
                mode designed to be open to many inputs in various forms from different kinds of people. These works
                flip the script of the auteurist, genre-structured long-form film toward the production of a space where
                people can convene to explore and unpack difficult ideas.</p>
            <p>As a scholar, a programmer, and a professor, I’m attracted to new developments that I do not fully
                comprehend.</p>

            <p><strong>Helen</strong>:<strong> </strong>In 2008, when I was co-director of NAMAC (now, <a
                    href="http://www.thealliance.media/">The Alliance</a>), we were deeply involved in learning how new
                forms of storytelling emerging online would affect the independent media making field. Ten years ago,
                broadband streaming was just emerging. People blogged everywhere. Funders started to pay attention to
                public engagement practices in communities beyond film festivals and television screens.</p>
            <p>Inspired and intrigued by what I was learning and seeing, I immersed myself in a new, iterative
                documentary project to take advantage of emerging digital platforms built for participation and
                exchange. In a mosaic of twelve short films of varying lengths, <em><a
                        href="http://www.lunchlovecommunity.org/">Lunch Love Community</a></em><em> </em>explored a
                local, pioneering food-justice movement. Through a range of stories, we took a deep look at how one
                community transformed its public school food program, and changed the way that children eat.</p>
            <p>I was excited to explore how we could creatively use online spaces to deliver the films, spark curiosity
                among new audiences, and expand how communities could use them get people working together for better
                nutrition and health education.</p>
            <p>Patty and I discovered that the new media projects that drew us in blended together unusual combinations
                of forms, contexts, and connections with communities finding one another on evolving online platforms
                and in real places. They combined documentary, narrative, and journalism in new ways.</p>
            <p>We wanted to connect this work to an historical lineage of collaborative arts, social engagement, and
                community-based work. The open space framework offered a fitting conceptual lineage. It also connected
                these new works to design, architecture, dialogic communication, and the hidden histories of
                twentieth-century radical film collectives, collaborations, and participatory mediamaking experiments.

            <p><strong>Early in the book, you write that open space documentaries “act as experiments in how to think
                    through and design dialogic approaches to political crises and traumas,” that is, they “generate
                    open-ended ideas, questions, solutions, and actions” rather than “producing images or
                    artifacts.”</strong></p>
            <p><strong>You mention that documentary needs to contend with the reality that some stories will remain
                    unresolved. What prompted such an insight? I’m wondering whether it emerged in part from
                    community-based practice, particularly Helen’s </strong><em>Love Lunch
                    Community</em><strong>.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Helen</strong>:<strong> </strong>An open space documentary work is dynamic. It is open to
                iterative growth and change.</p>
            <p>The projects explored in our book complicate questions and issues rather than simplifying them. They
                invite the viewer-participant to take the time and effort to explore the layered thickness of the
                artists’ proposition or inquiry. They do not offer tidy narrative bundles aimed at entertainment.
                Meaning shape shifts depending on where the work is encountered, whether online, at a film festival, a
                community screening, or in a classroom.</p>
            <p>Echoing other twentieth-century experimental forms, these creators foreground the discovery and growth
                process rather than the final product. This orientation toward process clears different pathways and
                makes new combinations. Because the media artifacts can easily be distributed, discussed, and developed
                as they are created in real time, open space media generates different questions and actions as the work
                evolves.</p>
            <p>In open space documentary, makers can explore relationships that develop with the subjects and
                participants as co-creators from the beginning development of the project to production to bringing it
                out in a public sphere. In most long form documentary films, these kinds of relationship are usually
                repressed and not recognized.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>An open space documentary work is dynamic.</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Patty</strong>:<strong> </strong>We kept asking: why are these works different, and how are they
                designed?</p>
            <p>I heard scholars and programmers proclaim that new media forms lack argument or a position. Intuitively,
                I did not agree. So many new media artists and collectives that I programmed through FLEFF addressed
                very contentious issues such as climate disruption, water, land, extraction, war, migration, toxicities,
                and displacement as spaces to investigate and complicate.</p>
            <p>I began to wonder why I found these projects, which created new kinds of interfaces or used a combination
                of new technologies, so exciting and so provocative compared to long-form analog films. Although still
                very important for festivals and for the world, these films felt earnest and predictable in comparison.
            </p>
            <p>I began to think about how these works were open in terms of how they considered production,
                distribution, and exhibition as permeable and ever-changing.</p>
            <p><strong>I really appreciated your focus on twelve projects that might ordinarily be overlooked by
                    documentary studies because they are not theatrically screened, feature-length films. I also
                    appreciated that many of your examples were primarily the work of women.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>You were writing before Silicon Valley’s “bro culture” made international headlines, particularly
                    after Emily Chang’s book </strong><em>Brotopia </em><strong>(2018). I’m wondering in what ways a
                    feminist media practice informed your thinking.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Patty</strong>: Helen and I come out of decades of feminist media theory and practice. It’s our
                training as undergraduates in the 1970s, graduate students in the 1980s, and as people involved in
                public media since then in various capacities: professors, programmers, board members, executive
                directors, festival directors, and producers.</p>
            <p>I’d like to say we were completely self-conscious about the focus on women, but we only discovered that
                feature once the book was almost done.</p>
            <p>Feature-length theatrical films have emerged primarily as the domain of white men. There are gendered
                inequities in documentary and new media studies. The tech world, whether Silicon Valley or new media
                artists, becomes a refuge for men and their machines.</p>
            <p>Instead of critiquing this situation, we discovered a very wide exciting world of work designed on
                feminist principles of collaboration, movement, equality, convenings, heterogeneous discourses, and
                multiple technologies. This work, privileges people, ideas and over technologies.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>We discovered a very wide exciting world of work designed on feminist principles of collaboration,
                    movement, equality, convening, heterogeneous discourses, and multiple technologies.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Helen</strong>:<strong> </strong>I have always struggled working through the gaps between my
                ambitions and the systemic limitations that I face as a woman working in the media world.</p>
            <p>As these new digital platforms opened up niches for creative inquiry, I imagined these new public spaces
                held the potential for different forms of storytelling and distribution. Because there was so much
                freedom, these emerging spaces evoked feminist media-making legacies that made sense to me as a working
                mother, juggling multiple obligations.</p>
            <p>For me that meant designing a project where I could practice listening to story participants and working
                deeply in my own community. I needed to recognize and work with my geographic and financial limitations
                because of family needs. I also wanted to rethink collaborative processes with feminist principles in
                mind while embracing the energy of the small place as valuable to explore.</p>
            <p>In the example of <em>Lunch Love Community</em>, that meant observing, filming, and engaging with
                partners and participants in our own Berkeley neighborhoods and schools. The project was designed to
                come from a place of local knowledge with all its revealing conflicts, contradictions, and
                complications. I did not parachute into the story, I walked around the streets where I already was
                living and working.</p>
            <p>As a new media project, my work on <em>Lunch Love Community </em>was a big surprise. As we were making
                it, I ended up taking the time to write and reflect about the process. I wrote blogs, articles, reports,
                and reflective essays on how this episodic documentary was doing its job in the world, how it was
                connecting to broader issues, and how it was having an impact on my own experience as a filmmaker.</p>
            <p>This writing places the work dynamic, which took place from 2008 to 2013, within two fields of vision:
                the narrow lens of my own activities and insights and the wider lens of feminist media practice.</p>
            <p>For the book, it was natural for me to be interested in work with a particular feminist sensibility that
                cleared out pathways similar to <em>Lunch Love Community.</em></p>
            <p><strong>Another principle that you make throughout the book is “speaking alongside and with the subject
                    rather than </strong><em>for</em><strong> the subject.” You draw upon David MacDougall’s notion of
                    transcultural film, but he does not address that wide array of formats and platforms that you
                    discuss. You emphasize horizontality of interaction and exchange as an ethical opposition to the
                    entrenched verticality of individualism evident in documentary and essay films that garner awards at
                    commercial film festivals such as Cannes, Toronto, and Sundance.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Could you say a little more about how open space documentary can transform “ordinary citizens
                    into agents with valued points of view?”</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Helen</strong>:<strong> </strong>It was a powerful revelation for us when we visualized the power
                dynamic in the digital sphere as a <em>circle </em>rather than a <em>triangle </em>with producers and
                subjects at the base and audiences at the top.</p>
            <p>The relationships among makers, subjects, and audiences flatten out into horizontal fields. Instead of
                the well-controlled, streamlined long-form film that ends with a resolved conclusion, these projects
                designed physical and virtual spaces for participants and audiences to add, subtract, and modify what
                was in and around the project’s media environment.</p>
            <p>When visitors and audiences are invested in the subject, they can use the projects in new ways in their
                own worlds.</p>
            <p>The media ecology that we inhabit is a mosaic of voices competing for attention. In this moment of
                weaponized media, the ability to open up the lens and harness collective complex perspectives will be
                the most striking and valuable work going forward.</p>
            <p>How documentarians make work that gathers people together to process complicated questions and
                experiences is the life-affirming energy of open-space documentary our book explores.</p>
            <p>People want their life experiences to be recognized and understood. They do not want to be used as
                characters in a movie’s narrative. In contrast, open-space new media documentary uses a multilayered,
                nonlinear, reflective, and active approach designed for exchange and sharing of aspirations, emotions,
                and sensibilities among participants.</p>
            <p>When co-creative collaborators work together in a slow process of developing and becoming, the kind of
                deeper dialogues that we value surface.</p>

            <p><strong>Patty</strong>: Most documentary consolidates, translates, persuades, and explains situations.
                Open-space new media documentary works design across platforms. They create new territories for urgency,
                disorderliness, and heterogeneity. These works do not close down and limit, but create locations for
                speaking alongside in various horizontal formations.</p>

            <p><strong>In your discussion of Elizabeth Miller’s </strong><em>The Shore Line </em><strong>as responses to
                    the violence of climate change, you mention that the project’s multilayered storytelling “displays
                    points of convergence” that can “encourage self-reflection and creative response.”</strong></p>
            <p><strong>In your discussion of Dorit Nauman’s </strong><em><a
                        href="https://jerusalemwearehere.com">Jerusalem, We Are Here</a></em><em> </em><strong>as
                    responses to the violence of Israel’s ongoing erasure of Palestinian, Armenian, Greek, and other
                    non-European histories in Al Quds (Jerusalem) since the Nakba, you cite the project’s recovery of
                    “home movies” as “citizen journalism.”</strong></p>
            <p><strong>How can documentarians ensure that urgent questions reach audiences invested in thinking together
                    for climate and political justice?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Patty</strong>: The question of how to reach and engage audiences is a key operating principle
                and an ongoing question in open-space documentary. In these works, exhibition and audiences are never
                assumed.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Miller selects different pieces from <em>The Shore Line </em>for different settings [when she
                exhibits the project]. She looks for resonances and then opens up discussion in between the short
                pieces. Dorit Naaman uses the tours imbedded in <em>Jerusalem We Are Here </em>as a model for guiding
                audiences through her project.</p>
            <p>Open-space media challenges festival programmers and museum curators. It’s quite different than simply
                showing a film followed by a moderated Q&amp;A.</p>
            <p>As a programmer, I have to collaborate with the makers to figure out who can moderate this type of
                encounter. The moderator needs to establish context, bring out ideas, and invite the audience into the
                work in a different way that the festival auteurist model.</p>

            <p><strong>Helen</strong>:<strong> </strong>In my experience as a director/producer/artist, this happens
                through intentionally reaching out to and partnering with people, both as individuals and in groups, who
                want to practice dialogue for change beyond partisan conflict. Points of convergence happen when we
                listen for ambiguity, nuance, and emerging contradictions. They form the mosaic structure of the work.
            </p>
            <p>In our book, we discuss ten working principles to produce this kind of open space work. These principles
                give makers and researchers a toolkit to anchor a process.</p>
            <p>These principles are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>circularity:</em><strong> </strong>a responsive and adaptive exchange among collaborators</li>
                <li><em>collaboration:</em><strong> </strong>necessary activity for co-creation and iteration</li>
                <li><em>community: </em>what we are building in a real place</li>
                <li><em>complexity:</em><strong> </strong>applying design thinking across forms</li>
                <li><em>composting: </em>artifacts in flux of loss and renewal</li>
                <li><em>connection:</em> seeding empathy across boundaries</li>
                <li><em>context:</em><strong> </strong>finding places for growth and change</li>
                <li><em>continuum: </em>where we are in our participatory process</li>
                <li><em>conversation: </em>designing for transformational dialogue</li>
                <li><em>cost:</em><strong> </strong>estimating, improvising, and adapting</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>I found that your chapter on polyphonic collaborations made productive connections between
                    digital structures and radical historiography. That is, open-space documentaries allow user to
                    recombine data into information that often contradicts official histories and narratives.</strong>
            </p>
            <p><strong>The idea of layering additional stories to reveal the contours of incredibly complex political
                    and social situations is powerful. Historiography becomes activism.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>One possible concern is that people may be intimidated from participating in such projects due to
                    the potential use of user-generated content as evidence by repressive regimes or societies. You
                    mention it in relation to the women subjected to forced sterilization who contributed to Maria Court
                    and Rosemarie Lerner’s </strong><em><a

                        Project</a></em><strong>. What strategies are new media documentarians utilizing to assure
                    participants of protections?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>What strategies are new media documentarians utilizing to assure participants of
                    protections?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Patty</strong>:<strong> </strong>The question of participation and protection is very complex in
                these works. As both a concept and a practice, participation is variegated and multiple, ranging from
                wandering around in a site, to being part of the design process, to sharing stories, to joining a
                convening, to observing, to working as a co-creator.</p>
            <p>Participation migrates across concept, design, production, distribution, and exhibition — a continual
                circle of enactment and shape-shifting forms. Because many topics pose threats to participants,
                open-space new media designers need to always think through the conjunctions of small spaces,
                contentious social and political situations, and risks posed to participants.</p>
            <p>Technologists —who think through how technologies can be designed and reverse-engineered to solve
                problems in a sustainable way — become key players in open-space new media, a major difference from
                analog documentary.</p>
            <p><em>The Quipu Project </em>confronted the question of Quechua speaking women in remote areas who had been
                sterilized and then silenced. They lived in regions without internet access.</p>
            <p>The project’s goal was to collect testimony to be used to achieve justice in Peru for these women who
                endured these operations. Inexpensive phones were designed that facilitated women calling into a number
                to share their stories anonymously.</p>
            <p>But technology was not operating alone — the Quipu producers collaborated with various feminist legal and
                support groups in Peru to mount many embodied convenings to discuss the project and the sterilizations.

            <p><strong>Helen</strong>:<strong> </strong>Is protection really possible now?</p>
            <p>I think we need to imagine and use different approaches towards building an awareness of media literacy
                among project participants. We honestly need to prepare people who choose to work with us for what it
                means to go public with their stories and experiences, and how meaning-filled — rather than fear-filled
                — those revelations will be.</p>
