            <h3 id="55af"><strong>Immerse: Creative discussion of emerging nonfiction storytelling</strong></h3>
            <p>Welcome to <em>Immerse</em>!</p>
            <p>How are we telling stories about the world today — and why?</p>
            <p>User participation, mobile, social, and gaming have already unsettled the waters of documentary and
                journalism. With the advent of a new wave of extended reality, this is a critical moment. We need a
                widespread public conversation around emerging media forms from across the globe because these new modes
                of storytelling are poised to shape the ways that billions of people learn, communicate, and understand
                themselves and the world.</p>
            <p>Launched in 2016, <em>Immerse</em> publishes regular features, along with responses to these pieces, plus
                roundups of relevant events and projects. With a curious and critical eye, we cover an array of topics:
                artificial intelligence, equity in tech, networked activism, nonfiction games, and more. We draw upon
                expertise across the field, as well as research and productions happening at MIT’s Open Documentary Lab.
            </p>
            <p>We are concerned with serious questions about the ethics, impact, and implications of emerging forms. But
                also we want to celebrate the explosion of creativity and wild experimentation that’s happening at the
                moment — to have fun, surprise you, and also surprise ourselves along the way.</p>
            <p>In the process, we take a broad look at what we mean when we say “nonfiction.” Where does “media” end and
                “reality” begin? Our goal is to explore many different variations — yes, journalism and documentary, but
                also speculative fiction based on real-world events, experiential media that sneaks up on you in
                familiar (and unfamiliar) places, and new concepts such as distributed storytelling.</p>
            <p>Our editorial board is comprised of leading curators of interactive and emerging media and has included
                people from the MIT Open Documentary Lab, i-Docs, Sundance Institute, IDFA DocLab, POV, and Tribeca Film
                Institute. But while we’re soliciting input from each of these leaders, Immerse is editorially
                independent. We’d also like ideas from you: our vibrant network of peers, readers, and practitioners.
            </p>
            <p>The spirit of this publication is collaboration, and access for all. We want to make sure that a diverse
                range of voices are heard and amplified and to address emerging storytelling from as many places in the
                world as possible.</p>

            <p>We are committed to exploring and showcasing media projects that push the boundaries of media and tackle
                issues of social justice — and rely on friends like you to sustain ourselves and grow. We hope you’ll
