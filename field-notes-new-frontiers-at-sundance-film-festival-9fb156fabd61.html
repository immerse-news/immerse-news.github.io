            <h2 id="3868">New Frontiers at Sundance Film Festival</h2>
            <h3 id="b01c">Human touch, social space, archiving for the future, and more</h3>
            <p>This year’s New Frontier exhibitions at Sundance showcased the explosive creativity that storytellers are
                tapping into as the technologies for immersive expression are maturing.</p>
            <p>Several works invited participants to explore <a
                    href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/02/sundance-vr-2020-spaced-out-pyrare-1202208370/">dissociative
                    states of consciousness</a> by integrating both narrative and embodied methods in VR, even
                introducing waterproof headsets, snorkels, and swimming pools to the mix. Others <a
                    href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/02/sundance-2020-vr-climate-change-1202208386/">investigated
                    issues of climate change</a> through various genres, including playful approaches in animation, or a
                combination of <a href="https://www.redcat.org/event/miwa-matreyek-infinitely-yours">live music, shadow
                    puppetry, and dance</a> to offer emotionally complex, layered performance. VR also proved to be a
                powerful medium to explore the spatial aspects of social justice, with projects that raised issues about
                incarceration and data privacy, or artificial intelligence and the nature of truth.</p>
            <p>Divided into four venues based on themes and methods, New Frontiers offered festival-goers an array of
                immersive technologies to experience, ranging from 360 videos to social VR performances to AR works
                overlaid onto the festival campus. Innovation in storytelling, however, certainly transcended these
                exhibition halls, and marked a spirit for creativity in thinking about the future of media. Here are
                some key notes:</p>
            <h3 id="8f39"><strong>Bringing a human touch to VR</strong></h3>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/600/338/0*balqa2gNOweTgoXm" width="600"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="15575563838808342676">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="15575563838808342676"><span class="marginnote"><em>Scarecrow (2020 ) — Image
                        courtesy of Sundance Institute, K’ARTS</em></span></figure>
            <p>When makers integrate human touch into a VR experience, an unexpected tension surfaces at the boundary
                between technology and the self. The South Korean team from K’ARTS beautifully guides users along this
                line in <em>Scarecrow,</em> a one-on-one VR immersive theatre piece that brings a live actor into the
                virtual experience. Through various techniques such as eye-tracking, motion capture, and thermal
                haptics, users build an emotional connection to the character, the act of touch evoking the question,
                “Is this allowed in VR?”</p>
            <p>Raising a similar question, social VR piece <em>Metamorphi</em>c brings in two users to interact with the
                environment, then gradually with each other. The interplay between the users is drawn out almost like a
                dance, asking their permission to go beyond the virtual. The AR work <em>Breathe,</em> on the other
                hand, enacts this interplay through the Magic Leap and a belt that senses the user’s breathing, making
                the body the centerpiece of the story.</p>

            <h3 id="6ceb"><strong>360 Video as Both Familiar and New</strong></h3>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/450/0*F9SZBfhUV0XcK6dH" width="800"><label

                    type="checkbox" id="11411960199699493376"><span class="marginnote"><em>Flowers &amp; a Switchblade
                        (2020) — Image courtesy of Sundance Institute</em></span></figure>
            <p>Several 360 videos were showcased in the VR Cinema sections, in which around thirty viewers experienced a
                series of four VR works in an hour-long block in a room together, followed by a Q&amp;A with the
                artists.</p>
            <p>VR Cinema 1 focused on pieces that offered a sense of presence in another locale, be it in the heart of a
                Cuban ritual as in <em><a href="https://newmenstudio.visura.co/about">Bembé</a></em> or at an abandoned
                mansion of South Africa in <em>Azibuye — the Occupation</em>. These works were familiar in form but
                raised important issues about political strife, incarceration, and nuclear disaster in some of the best
                VR journalism.</p>
            <p>VR Cinema 2, the second block, offered a more experimental selection that moved beyond straightforward
                360 videos. For instance, <em><a href="http://hominidanimation.net/">Hominade</a></em> constructed a
                surreal environment through x-ray imagery and anatomical reconstructions to tell the story of an
                invented species, while the conversation in <em><a
                        href="https://www.sundance.org/projects/flowers-a-switchblade">Flowers &amp; a
                        Switchblade</a></em> was represented through a video collage method that paralleled its theme
                about the fragmentation of modern life.</p>
            <h3 id="222b"><strong>Thinking critically about space</strong></h3>
            <p>Other projects complicated the relationship between the user’s body and social space it exists in.</p>
            <p><em><a href="https://www.sundance.org/projects/persuasion-machines">Persuasion Machines</a></em> takes
                users into a smart living room, where devices surveil and track personal data, opening into portals of
                big data and how it affects daily lives.</p>
            <p><em><a href="https://ajcontrast.com/">Still Here</a></em> is a VR and AR piece accompanied by a photo
                series of six women and their perspectives on the criminal justice system in New York. It follows the
                character Jasmine as she returns to Harlem after being incarcerated for 15 years, only to find it newly
                gentrified, erased of all that once made it familiar. In this AR piece, users walked around the New
                Frontiers exhibition space with a tablet in hand while hearing Jasmine’s story as she tries to find
                employment. Given that New Frontiers is a space marked by consumerist technologies and an
                industry-specific audience, the piece adds another layer of critique to the festival space itself. How
                is the concept of the “new” laden with erasures of the past?</p>
            <h3 id="f1b6"><strong>Artificial Intelligence and archiving for the future</strong></h3>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/534/0*Xw9Kf2-coz0AfMZv" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="4222772043350154457">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="4222772043350154457"><span class="marginnote">Lynn Hershman Leeson, Sandra
                    Rodriguez, and Nancy McGovern at the New Frontiers Panel</span></figure>
            <p>Both the allure of AI and the biases baked into it were on display at Sundance this year.</p>
            <p>In <em>Chomsky vs. Chomsky,</em> users are able to have a conversation with a simulation of Noam Chomsky,
                powered by extensive digital archives of his writings and Natural Language Processing. This piece
                challenges the expectations participants enter with in speaking to an AI-powered system. In the panel
                “AI, the Archive, and Creating Human Context on the New Frontier,” lead artist Sandra Rodriguez
                remarked, “There’s an irony in that you want to trust an AI system or want it to be free and open, but
                you don’t see where the controls are. The back-end really uses data that is highly biased.”</p>
            <p>This conversation was echoed by other MIT researchers featured in <em>Coded Bias</em>, a documentary film
                about how facial-recognition technology continues a lineage of algorithmic bias that perpetuates the
                oppression of marginalized communities. In creating AI-generated artworks, then, key questions about the
                archive, the sample data from which the future is based, become political ones.</p>
            <p>“The obsession for what is archivable or what is relevant as an archive or what isn’t, really suddenly
                becomes linked to phenomenons that are social or culturally driven,” said Sandra Rodriguez, “I want the
                machine to instead show us where the biases are, then at least we can start a conversation.”</p>
            <h3 id="8853"><strong>Innovation in storytelling beyond headsets and wearables</strong></h3>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/450/1*VQKNN5EFH4mrZ8pkYDqRfw.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="5144046481916407809">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="5144046481916407809"><span class="marginnote">Saudi
                    Runaway — Image courtesy of Sundance Institute</span></figure>
            <p>From the World Documentary Film section, <em>Saudi Runaway</em> captured audiences with its striking and
                unconventional use of mobile technology to offer a window into the pressures of living in a Muslim
                conservative society as a woman. Shot entirely on an iPhone, <em>Saudi Runaway</em> offers an intimate
                glimpse into the life of Muna, a soon-to-be bride planning to escape from her marriage and society. She
                secretly films by holding her camera phone from beneath her abaya and uploading all her footage to the
                cloud before her father searches her phone.</p>
            <p>The aesthetic produced by filming from a mobile phone represents both Muna’s courage in seeking a new
                life and creativity in producing her own narrative. <em>Saudi Runaway</em> brings to light the societal
                restrictions that Saudia Arabian women face, while also reminding us that innovation comes in forms
                beyond the newest consumer headsets and through the creative will to tell a story.</p>
            <p>These field notes encompass only a selection of the expansive VR/AR/XR forms exhibited this year at New
                Frontiers. The rich intellectual and artistic worlds within each of these projects makes New Frontier a
                breeding ground for ideas that have only yet begun to be realized.</p>
