            <p>By Kamal Sinclair</p>
            <p>For almost two years, on a daily basis, I’ve been asking myself and everyone in my radius: “How do we
                make a new reality that centers the values of equality, equity, and inclusion through <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/defining-emerging-media-b48794e15138">emerging media</a>?”</p>
            <p>The answers were dizzying and often felt beyond the reach of possibility, so there were moments I almost
                lost faith in the work. You can imagine my joy when the affirmations began to flow, first in a trickle
                and now in powerful waves, making it clear that this work is urgent, meaningful, and achievable.</p>

            <h3 id="7060"><em><strong>From the Deviant Geeks…</strong></em></h3>
            <p>This summer I made a trip to Silicon Valley. The first day I had a series of meetings at Stanford
                University that went from disheartening to transcendent. My early meetings exposed the thickness of the
                famed “Silicon Valley bubble,” when I realized that powerful and influential people on the campus had
                little reference for some of the most landmark works in emerging media storytelling and that their
                industry analysis (which informs some of the most powerful tech firms and investor cohorts in the
                industry) is faulty and skewed. I left the meeting feeling like there was no hope for working within
                Silicon Valley to make change and that maybe our only hope was to “Buckminster Fuller” emerging media
                and build new systems from the ground up.</p>
            <p>However, each meeting got successively more enlightened and engendered more hope, until my final meeting
                of the day with a mechanical engineer at the design school who exposed me to what he called “the deviant
                geeks” of Silicon Valley. He showed me that there is a passionate community of technologists and
                engineers who not only want to design for justice and well-being, but beauty. A powerful affirmation!
            </p>
            <p>The following day I went to Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park to present for the Oculus Women series
                with Yelena Rachitsky, at the invitation of Ebony Peay-Ramirez. Although I have great relationships with
                these women at Facebook, I was nervous to present <em>Making a New Reality</em> in this environment
                because of the <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/challenging-the-innovator-stereotype-3e3ef41857c">critiques</a>
                that emerged in the research of “the Valley” <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/making-a-new-reality-11cdb9951bb6">mythologies</a>, the company,
                and its <a href="https://makinganewreality.org/grappling-with-blind-spots-a1946f78b67c">founder</a>. I
                was steadied by the comments from a good number of interviewees who said it is critical for those
                working on equality to “be in the room” of these centers of power, despite suspicions, because it is a
                more powerful position to be “in the room” than “outside throwing rocks.”</p>
            <p>To my joy, the community I engaged at Facebook was ready and eager to have this frank conversation, to
                take ownership, and to work towards mitigating future blind spots. The event was maybe a third full,
                with a live video being streamed to staff at their desks. Throughout the talk and conversation people
                started coming down from their desks and coming into the room. The conversation was so robust we went
                almost an hour over the original end time. Afterwards I had person after person passionately asking how
                they could disrupt the blind spots in Silicon Valley and further design principles grounded in <a
                    href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/3-questions-sasha-costanza-chock-new-morethancode-report-0824">justice,
                    well-being, and prosperity</a>. Again, I was exposed to the <a
                    href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/silicon-valley-tech-companies-recruiting-protests-ethical?bftwnews&amp;utm_term=4ldqpgc#4ldqpgc">deviant
                    geeks</a> and they were awesome!!! Another wave of affirmation.</p>
            <p>Of course, these “geeks” represent a small fraction of people beginning to awaken, assemble, and
                collaborate on the future of culture. The momentum building in the <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TechWontBuildIt&amp;src=typd">#TechWontBuildIt</a>, <a

                <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HumaneTech&amp;src=typd">#HumaneTech </a>movements are a
                testament to that fact.</p>

            <h3 id="6932"><em><strong>From the Privileged…</strong></em></h3>
            <p>This month I attended a very prestigious event for producers of film and TV, where I had the opportunity
                to present on the <em>Making a New Reality</em> research. Affirmations came when person after person
                from centers of power like Amazon, Netflix, film studios, and financiers came up to me wanting to
                galvanize their resources to heed the call to action.</p>
            <p>One affirmation came to me while sitting in a dark screening room with 200 industry decision makers, when
                one white man made a vulnerable admission of his complicity in the suppression of black people in film.
                As we talked about the successes of <em>Black Panther </em>and <em>Moonlight</em>, he shared that for 12
                years he followed his mentors’ advice not to make black films if he wanted to make money, a choice he
                deeply regrets.</p>
            <p>For 20+ years I too heard the narrative that black people just needed more education, more skills, more
                artistry, or more willingness to play into the minstrel stereotypes in order to succeed. Just like him,
                I heard statements like: “Black films just don’t sell.” “This is a business first, so we have to make
                what sells.” “No one will believe that character, you need to make them more street.” Do you know how
                crazy that can make you feel? When you know the truth of your worth and when you doubt it?</p>
            <p>To hear him validate that there was <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/challenging-the-innovator-stereotype-3e3ef41857c">an explicit
                    narrative</a>, <a href="https://makinganewreality.org/making-a-new-reality-11cdb9951bb6">an industry
                    mythology</a>, that he bought into and helped perpetuate was an affirmation — at least that I’m not
                crazy. Then to hear him apologize was an affirmation that <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/disrupt-dependency-and-rigid-bias-narratives-a6f866563ac2">rigid
                    bias can change</a>. Truth and reconciliation is a powerful thing; even this small step towards it
                made a part of my heart soften. This <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/encourage-and-model-allyship-6289b2ab846e">small willingness to
                    tell the truth</a> caused something resembling healing in me.</p>
            <p>He was not the only one to break with narratives that perpetuate inequality, to demonstrate allyship, and
                to offer a commitment to change. It has been an increasing part of the conversation around this
                research. In fact, this part of the discourse has exposed another dominant narrative among those in
                positions of privilege that maintain the status quo, particularly related to white privilege.</p>
            <p>At one of the events where I presented the research, a white woman said, “I’m so excited for this
                initiative and 100% committed to diversity and inclusion, but how are we going to get white people to
                give up what they have, so others can have a seat at the table?”</p>
            <p>I was genuinely taken aback by her question, because I really never thought of it as a zero-sum
                proposition, where someone has to lose for others to gain. In fact, I never thought of “white people”
                having to give up anything, because I’ve always seen them as already operating in a deep deficit. The
                circumstances of history have caused massive numbers of non-white people to live under restrictive
                systems that hindered the development of their potential.</p>
            <p>There is empirical study after empirical study that shows the negative impact on all of us, when groups
                of people are not able to fulfill their potential. <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyN76oTt67M">We lose their brilliance</a> in whatever field of
                study or area of practice they would have advanced. We lose whatever contributions they may have made to
                science, medicine, technology, philosophy, art, culture, or commerce. Perhaps they had the potential to
                find a cure for the very ailment that will eventually kill you. We also gain the burden of human
                potential suppressed (i.e. expensive prison systems, abusive immigration systems, the impacts of poverty
                in our cities, climate change, war, and mental health epidemics).</p>
            <p>Those whose privilege is generated by the oppression of others over long periods of time suffer from this
                “privilege.” They suffer the loss of contributions oppressed peoples could have made to their
                well-being, as we discussed <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/the-high-stakes-of-limited-inclusion-8c11541829f6">in the first
                    article</a> when unpacking Heather Rae’s quote about climate change and its direct correlation to
                the oppression of indigenous peoples contributions to designing our value systems in the industrial age.
                They also suffer from the mental health impacts of generations of their kin living in the constant fear
                and paranoia of rebellion, the guilt of benefiting from another’s pain, the consequences of <a
                    href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15299732.2017.1295373">victim-perpetrator
                    dynamics</a>, and/or the dissociation with reality caused by the dehumanization of another to
                preserve a moral self-identity.</p>
            <p>The fears embedded in the “zero-sum” framing in the context of furthering diversity, equality, equity,
                and inclusion is probably a key factor in our failure to achieve these goals in media and in society.
                Especially, when notions of scarcity helped fuel systems of oppression historically and systems of
                oppression help fuel fear or paranoia of the other, or of the oppressed. The fears embedded in notions
                of scarcity also fuel our frenzied appetite for exponential growth, expansion, and productivity, which
                can hinder the adoption of the values of reflection, collaboration, and consultation.</p>
            <p>As Morgan Willis, Director of the Allied Media Conference, told me during my interviews for this research
                project:</p>
            <p><em>The person that needs to be most changed in this scenario is ‘this guy’ who is making the decisions
                    because he’s the one in power to ultimately put people in these positions… There’s such inequity and
                    inequality that it is ‘his’ responsibility to both receive the diverse people coming to him AND to
                    do the work of recruiting people from underrepresented groups… Ultimately, that handful of
                    [privileged] people are going to have to accept their responsibility to diversify their rooms if it
                    is ever going to change.</em></p>
            <p><em>How do we structure involvement at that level in a way that </em><a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/the-radical-opportunity-4584ed4601fd">resources him with a
                    framework</a><em>, a blueprint and the tools, language, and a way of holding him accountable to
                    doing something that he’s probably never had to do? We have to consider that throughout his entire
                    life, he’s never had to think about who to put in a room. That does not mean that he’s not able to
                    be transformed.</em></p>
            <p><em><strong>If he does this, his room will give back. </strong></em><em>You’re diversifying not just the
                    representation of people, but ideas, creativity, imagination and perspective. You can’t really get
                    that when you have a room full of yourself.</em></p>
            <p>Scarcity is an antiquated concept, but our economic systems are still operating on the fear of it and
                therefore perpetuating a constant and exponential hunger for growth, especially for those that have
                already accumulated more than they could ever use. We are in an age of abundance, but we are still
                operating on the subconscious survival mechanisms of scarcity.</p>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence alone is a <a

                that can help us manage the earth’s resources in a sustainable and balanced way (even if it will never
                be the same as it was as it was before human-induced climate change) if we have the will to re-organize
                according to this new reality. We have enough to feed, house, and provide medical care for the earth
                population right now<em> if we can create the political will.</em></p>
            <p>And if we care for more than just people’s bodies and elevate their intellectual and creative potential,
                we will attain a level of civilization that we’ve never seen. We can enact an enlightenment and become a
                more true civilization, not one that claims allegiance to civility but fails in practice. We have the
                opportunity to become a better version of ourselves.</p>

            <p>There has been a wonderful response from philanthropists, academic institutions, industry related
                companies and community organizations. In fact, we are already exploring strategies with institutions
                such as Johns Hopkins University, MIT and Stanford University to apply the recommendations from the
                research in intersectional programs and pedagogy. We are also developing initiatives to share the
                research in communities that are ripe for taking leadership positions in furthering equality in emerging
                media. Finally, we are planning further opportunities to convene as a field to outline strategies for
                structural change to enable the artists, technologists, policymakers, community leaders and scientists
                to make a new reality.</p>
            <p>At <em>Immerse</em>, we’ll continue to both amplify the findings and insights from the Making a New
                Reality research, and to find new writers and respondents to explore these themes. To do this, I’ll be
                stepping into a new role, as a contributing editor for the publication: send me your story ideas at <a
                    href="mailto:newreality@immerse.news">newreality@immerse.news</a>.</p>
            <p>We’ll also need your help to spread the word. Below, you’ll find a summary of the research that you can
                share with colleagues, students, inventors, investors, and anyone else who has a stake in this issue.
                Please tag us on Twitter using the<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=makinganewreality&amp;src=typd">
                    #makinganewreality</a> hashtag; we are excited to see how the conversation evolves.</p>
            <p>On the <em>Making a New Reality </em>site this month, you’ll also find notes from the Ford Foundation
                JustFilm’s Emerging Media Summit, a summary of the research, and a framework for action. Stay tuned for
                more in the coming months.</p>
