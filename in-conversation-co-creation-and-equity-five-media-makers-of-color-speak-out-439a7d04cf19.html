            <p>There is a political yearning and narrative turn toward a more ethical form of storytelling inherent in
                the co-creation process. This is undoubtedly an auspicious moment. However, for media makers of color,
                there’s one vital concern. While it has been acknowledged that the co-creation of stories can be traced
                back to early civilizations, there has not been an explicit recognition of the specific ways media
                makers of color have shaped and inspired contemporary co-creation practices, emerging from
                accountability to their communities, the drive for more complex representation, and the necessity of
                creating media with fewer financial resources than their white counterparts.</p>
            <p>Oftentimes, media makers of color, especially those documenting urgent political issues, are faced with
                increased demands of proving their professional media-making expertise within the field, acting as
                cultural interpreters between their communities and the field, and ensuring respectful engagement of
                their cultural communities. This complex navigation has given rise to deeply organic and mindful
                co-creation processes that predate the increasingly popular use of the term within the media-making
                field.</p>
            <p>To present co-creation within media as a re-emergent practice without explicitly acknowledging the
                longstanding co-creative approaches practiced by communities of color doesn’t simply erase their work,
                it undermines the very tenets of co-creation.</p>
            <p>At its core, co-creation seeks to reconcile systemic power and singular authority. This fundamental
                principle extends beyond the creative process within media-making, compelling all of us to interrogate
                fundamental ideas of ownership, meaning-making, attribution and — if we optimize the potential of
                co-creation — realize a more just society. With this larger imperative in mind, this conversation seeks
                to provide an overview of the longstanding co-creative practices of artists of color.</p>
            <p>The idea for this work is derived from a break-out group conversation, which took place at the two-day
                symposium, COLLECTIVE WISDOM: Co-Creating Media with Communities, across Disciplines and with
                Algorithms, organized by the Co-Creation Studio at the MIT Open Documentary Lab. Its content is not
                meant to be comprehensive nor does this work represent the multifarious approaches and perspectives of
                media makers. The functions of this dialogue are to begin to map the history of co-creation across
                communities of color within the U.S., to explore non-institutional power, innovation, and co-operation
                amongst media makers of color, and to unpack the uncalculated costs and labor of deep co-creation
                processes.</p>
            <p>The content presented here is based on a conversation structured around a series of prompts that have
                been edited for brevity and includes our collective voices.</p>

                    Anderson</span></figure>
            <p><strong>Maria Agui Carter </strong>is an Indigenous Latinx/Chinese immigrant who grew up undocumented in
                NYC and graduated from Harvard. She is an award-winning filmmaker (Iguanafilms.com), teaches as an
                Assistant Professor at Emerson College, and serves on the Diversity Coalition of the WGA (Writers Guild
                of America).</p>
            <p><strong>Thomas Allen Harris </strong>is an artist who uses media, photography, and performance to explore
                family and identity, in a participatory model of filmmaking, since 1990. He is presently in production
                on <em>Family Pictures</em> USA — a new PBS series that examines America through the lens of the “family
                photo album,” slated for national broadcast in 2019. Born in the Bronx and raised in East Africa, Harris
                is a graduate of Harvard College with a degree in biology and is presently a Senior Lecturer at Yale
                University, where he teaches courses related to his socially engaged art project, Digital Diaspora
                Family Reunion.</p>
            <p><strong>Maori Karmael Holmes </strong>is a filmmaker, writer, and curator. She is founder and artistic
                director of the BlackStar Film Festival. She has organized programs in film at a myriad of organizations
                including Anthology Film Archives, Institute of Contemporary Art — Philadelphia, Lightbox Film Center,
                Museum of Contemporary Art — Los Angeles, The Underground Museum, and The Whitney Museum. As a
                filmmaker, her works have screened internationally.</p>
            <p><strong>Michèle Stephenson</strong> is a Brooklyn-based media maker, author and artist who pulls from her
                Haitian and Panamanian roots to tell complex intimate stories by, for, and about, communities of color.
                Along with her partner, Joe Brewster, she co-founded multiple award-winning media production company,
                Rada Film Group.</p>
            <p><strong>Juanita Anderson</strong> is a veteran producer and documentary filmmaker who proudly hails from
                Detroit, Michigan. Her career as a producer, director, production manager, and executive producer
                includes 17 years at public television stations WSIU, WTVS, and WGBH before embarking on a career in
                independent media in 1993. A former lead producer of two of public television’s longest-running
                African-American television series, <em>Detroit Black Journal</em> and <em>Say Brother</em>, she
                co-founded the National Black Programming Consortium (now Black Public Media) in 1978. Anderson joined
                the faculty of the Department of Communication at Wayne State University in 2003, where she currently
                heads the Media Arts and Studies program. She also serves as a principal advisor to the Detroit
                Narrative Agency.</p>
            <h3 id="6c9d"><strong>Part I: Interrogating the mainstream framing of media-making</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Juanita:</strong> For me, the moment that I questioned what we were doing at MIT was during a
                panel session where someone commented that they spoke to the community members rather than journalists.
                I was thinking, obviously, as people of color, we always speak to our communities first. We’ve been
                working from a co-creation model for decades — taking us right back to the history of African American,
                Latinx, and Asian American programming in public television back in the late 1960s. Television series
                like <em>Black Horizons</em> in Pittsburgh, <em>Say Brother</em> in Boston, and <em>Detroit Black
                    Journal—</em>all launched in 1968—had community advisory boards and community input all along the
                way in terms of both the content and management of those programs. The failure to recognize this and
                many other histories demonstrates an issue in current co-creation conversations that hasn’t been
                resolved. There doesn’t seem to be a priority to support media-makers of color working within their own
                communities. Are we talking about white media-makers going into communities where they have never been
                before?</p>
            <p><strong>Thomas:</strong> I definitely concur with what Juanita says. It’s also important to note that
                within the larger context of colonialism, there is a certain class of people going in and telling
                stories of a wide range of historically marginalized communities. Today, because of the economics of
                long-form documentary production as well as pressure by distributors for diversity of representation,
                there is increased talk of co-creation, which I think is a response to these changes. I’m wondering if
                collaboration is really happening or whether it’s a certain kind of blackface or Asian face — a cover to
                continue to exploit these communities for content and access to funding and distribution in an age of
                multiculturalism.</p>
            <p>A focus of many of my mentors — William Greaves, St. Clair Bourne, Pearl Bowser, Marlon Riggs, Camille
                Billips — was critiquing dominant modes of representation that served to disenfranchise their
                communities while simultaneously empowering these communities by providing access to tools, a voice as
                well as modalities of storytelling that communities could use for self-representation. This process, and
                the community building it engendered, was considered in some cases just as important as the final film.
            </p>
            <p>This process of community engagement as part of the production, together with a merging of art and
                activism, placed many of these projects within the avant-garde. I’m thinking particularly of Greaves’
                <em>Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One, </em>or Camille Billops’ <em>Suzanne Susanne</em>,<em> </em>or the
                early pioneers of black independent film that Pearl Bowser’s work has documented over decades, or Marlon
                Rigg’s <em>Tongue Untied. </em>Yet, much of this work was not critically appraised sufficiently within
                the field until years after they were made, if ever. This benign neglect, often due to the work’s
                resistance of certain stereotypical narratives, resulted in their marginalization so that today some can
                speak about co-creation as something new, without feeling the responsibility to find and cite precedence
                within media makers of color that have long been ignored by the mainstream. The result is a kind of a
                painful double negation. So, as we revisit or re-package the concept of co-creation, it’s important for
                us to interrogate our power relationships and our motivations vis-à-vis process, community as well as
                outcomes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Michèle:</strong> Yeah. I want to affirm what’s already been said. I also want to question the
                current emphasis on co-creation in the field. Is it simply a way to legitimize a space for dominant
                culture to continue to be involved in telling our stories; a way of keeping some sort of white control
                and presence over narratives by and about communities of color? I won’t get into the whole capitalism
                versus collaboration model that has existed in media-making for a long, long, time, but, as Thomas
                mentioned, power is shifting more significantly now in dominant spaces. We can’t ignore that this
                co-creation conversation is gaining all this visibility and weight at a time when people of color are
                commanding more authorship power. Suddenly, single authorship is being questioned and talk of
                co-creation is taking place within the mainstream.</p>

                    Maria Agui Carter</span></figure>
            <p><strong>Maria:</strong> I couldn’t agree more with Michèle, Juanita, and Thomas — such great points. I
                originally studied anthropology, a discipline predicated on the belief that it is possible for an
                outsider to parachute into a community and gain access to its culture, knowledge, and stories, then
                speak for them to the rest of the world. I remember reading Claude Levi Strauss’ <em>Tristes
                    Tropiques</em>, a book by the much celebrated French anthropologist, one of the fathers of
                anthropology whose memoir I found racist and problematic.</p>
            <p>As one of the “natives” that he would have talked about, I found him to be so bound by his own cultural
                biases that he could not truly see, and I questioned his capacity to spend limited time with a community
                and yet understand it well enough to properly frame the story or ask the right questions. He is someone
                who spent little time in the field and yet made sweeping pronouncements about how the “natives” thought.
                I think of the arrogance of his observations and his many books as an “expert” on other cultures given
                he was known to have said, “fieldwork is a kind of women’s work (which is probably why women are so
                successful at it) … I had neither the interest nor the patience for it.”</p>
            <p>It reminds me of documentary filmmaking when people (usually extremely sympathetic and well-meaning) from
                outside our communities of color choose to speak for us without having put in the equivalent of the
                research and field work that earns them the right to make those observations. The research we do as
                filmmakers of color about our own communities often lasts a lifetime and is not just that of lived or
                shared experience. So many of us specialize not just in the craft of filmmaking, but in reading and
                researching the arts, the culture, the politics of our own people and our communities as well as those
                of the larger communities around us.</p>
            <p>With regards to co-creation and collaboration, as filmmakers of color making films about our communities,
                we have always felt that we needed to speak and to listen to those from within. Yet we are not credited
                by the power structures as experts. Instead, we are often accused of bias. Nor are we often funded
                adequately to tell our own stories. For instance, in the foundation world in the United States, the last
                studies I read showed that Latinx organizations across all fields receive about one percent of all
                foundation dollars — that includes everything, from direct services to the arts and film. Yet we make up
                almost 18% of the US population and we now have a very large community of trained Latinx media-makers
                and storytellers. And so, it’s not just that our stories need to be told, it’s important that the world
                respect, fund, and support our telling our own stories.</p>
