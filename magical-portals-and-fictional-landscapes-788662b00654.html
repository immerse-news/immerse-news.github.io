            <p><em>Sara Snyder is the chief of External Affairs and Digital Strategies at the Smithsonian American Art
                    Museum and Renwick Gallery. </em>Immerse<em> editor Jessica Clark spoke with her about how these two
                    institutions are discovering, creating, and exhibiting 360 videos, VR, and other interactive
                    works.</em></p>
            <h3 id="5831">Tell us a bit about your work.</h3>
            <p>I do public-facing work with the museum, from communications marketing and social media to digital video
                production and various events and activities. Most of that is centered on our temporary exhibits. We
                have up to a dozen shows a year across two main buildings</p>
            <h3 id="6ffb"><strong>How long have you been experimenting with immersive tech?</strong></h3>
            <p>We started working in VR in 2016. At that time, the Renwick Gallery had just reopened after renovation.
                We built the museum with an immersive installation, <em><a
                        href="https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/wonder">Wonder</a></em>. It was nine galleries,
                each with site-specific work by contemporary artists who had been commissioned to explore common
                materials and craft in a new way.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/530/0*sT7lPH8Jhp36-Y58" width="800"><label

                    type="checkbox" id="11931151877205852222"><span class="marginnote">Gabriel Dawe, <em>Plexus A1,

            <p>That show was runaway success; we had some of the best attendance we’d ever seen at the gallery.
                <em>Wonder</em> was meant to transport visitors into thinking about everyday objects in a different way.
                There was an installation by Gabriel Dawe, where he filled the room with threads in rainbow hues. You
                felt as if you were in a magical environment but it all crafted out of simple thread.</p>
            <p>People loved the show and asked us how we were going to capture it. It was site-specific, so it would be
                gone. At that time in 2016, it seemed like everybody was getting a 360 camera and so we worked hard
                before the show closed to capture it as best we could in high-resolution 360. We created an app, which
                you can still download on your phone, <em><a href="https://americanart.si.edu/wonder360">Wonder
                        360</a></em>, and it’s a little time capsule of the show.</p>
            <p>We showed it to one of our board members and he thought it was okay but wanted to be able to move freely
                within the space, as a fully rendered three-dimensional world. That’s the limitation of 360 video. So,
                he put us in touch with friends and we connected with VR producers. We also talked to Intel, our funding
                partner, which was interested in seeing VR used for purposes other than gaming.</p>
            <p>We’ve since done two VR projects with Intel support. One of them is called <em><a
                        href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1087320/Smithsonian_American_Art_Museum_Beyond_The_Walls/">Beyond
                        the Walls</a></em>, which is a capture of our permanent collection galleries and our main
                building. It takes some works from the late nineteenth century and some from the twentieth century and
                lets you explore those works in our museum. There are also magical portals hidden around the space that
                allow users to teleport. For example, you’re standing in front of the painting of the Aurora Borealis,
                thinking about how Edwin Church saw this national phenomenon at the end of the Civil War — and what it
                meant to him — and then you can be transported to see footage of Aurora Borealis in the sky, taken in
                Iceland.</p>
            <p>There’s also a sculpture that was created as a graveside memorial at Rock Creek Cemetery in DC, and
                another one in the art museum. So, we created a teleportation tunnel that allows people to stand in
                front of the version at the museum and be “transported” to the cemetery with the breeze in the
                background. Some of the greatest American sculpture in this country is in cemeteries, so it’s an
                educational exploration. It took a while to get the interpretation part right. We hope to have that for
                download within a few weeks.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/621/1*cMJdE080m0d17_HBAmaIXg.png"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>The other project we worked on with Intel is perhaps the most ambitious, <em><a
                        href="https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/burning-man">No Spectators:</a></em> <em><a
                        href="https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/burning-man">the Art of Burning Man</a></em><em>.
                </em>We knew we wanted to capture it in 3D and make sure it could be rendered in a fully explorable
                world. So we captured the whole show, put it on <a href="https://www.sansar.com/">Sansar</a>. The idea
                here is that you can see a museum show with others — your friends’ avatars can be walking around
                experiencing the VR together. The download is free but the room-scale experience can really only be
                experienced with the fancy headsets, such as Vibe or Oculus.</p>
            <p>An important part of Burning Man is the environment in which is takes place, at the open desert in
                Nevada, so this doesn’t really capture the feeling of what Burning Man is like in person. But we were
                able to take a number of outdoor sculptures that were commissioned for the neighborhood and virtually
                place them in an imaginary desert-scape. You can walk out the door and instead of being in the Golden
                Triangle neighborhood of northwest D.C., you’re in a desert-scape with 40 people and you can see this
                sculpture in that context. You can climb up on top of the sculpture, something we definitely don’t let
                you do in the museum!</p>
            <p>We sent that show on the road. It’s in Cincinnati now. It’ll be in Oakland later, but the virtual capture
                of that show can live on and reach more people than are able to come in person.</p>
            <h3 id="0dd1"><strong>What kind of responses are you getting from the exhibition?</strong></h3>
            <p>The goal with the room-scale, more ambitious projects was to see whether there was any interest. This was
                all very untested; there was no benchmark for what success would look like. The responses we received
                from visitors have been wonderful. Many people have come away raving. I feel like offering art to people
                in this platform is important. Gaming and entertainment are a given, but it has the potential of
                offering completely transformative transporting experiences.</p>
            <h3 id="1d42"><strong>Are you at a point where you can find those artists?</strong></h3>
            <p>Yes, we worked at one of them with the Burning Man show: Android Jones. He created a fictional landscapes
                inspired by Burning Man. We’re seeing more artists. Companies such as HTC and others are investing in
                VR; it’s a long-term strategy to have larger audience for their platforms.</p>

                    American Art Museum</span></figure>
            <h3 id="bc4e"><strong>What other projects are on the docket?</strong></h3>
            <p>One other thing that our museum does is engage with the gaming. We had a really popular show in 2012,
                <em>The Art of Video Games</em>. I expect to see more exploration around media arts. If you can build
                sculpture and create immersive environments on another planet in VR, why not?</p>
            <p>But it’s a lot of hardware maintenance and staffing. When we had the Android Jones VR work in the
                gallery, we had two gallery attendants who worked full-time to help people get in and out of the
                headsets. There’s a lot of needed wiping and disinfecting and charging the hand controllers. I’m much
                more interested in how we can provide and curate content for people who have the technology available to
                them in other spaces — homes or classrooms, for instance — than in doing that.</p>
            <p>We’re just not quite there yet with the adoption, but we’re seeing incredible progress with the
                untethered headset. Most people don’t want to set up a whole room in their house for VR. It needs to be
                more flexible. To me, the holy grail is when the tech disappears, and you’re in the world.</p>
            <h3 id="f4e2"><strong>This must be hard to find. Where do you go to talk about emerging media in the museum
                    space?</strong></h3>
            <p><a href="http://mcn.edu">Museum Computer Network</a> and <a href="https://www.museweb.net/">Museums and
                    the Web</a> are two annual meetings that are really inspirational. Also, <a
                    href="https://www.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a>.</p>
            <p><em>In a follow-up, Snyder noted that she’d be remiss if she didn’t also mention the current show</em> at
                the <em>Renwick Gallery</em>, <a href="https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/ruffner">Ginny Ruffner:
                    Reforestation of the Imagination</a>, <em>which</em> <em>mixes AR with physical artworks. Plus, the
