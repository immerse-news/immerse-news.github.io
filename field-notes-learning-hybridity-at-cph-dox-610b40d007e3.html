            <h3 id="b2e5">A festival dispatch covering the INTER:ACTIVE symposium and exhibition</h3>
            <p>CPH:DOX was the first international film festival to pivot online in March 2020. Last month, to
                widespread relief, it finally returned to cinemas and exhibition spaces across Copenhagen — but with one
                big difference. A silver lining of its two years online was that it also became accessible to audiences
                across Denmark: the 2020 festival reached over 100,000 viewers, many of whom would not have had the
                chance to engage with it in person. Keen to hold on to this accessibility win, this year CPH:DOX
                returned as a hybrid festival.</p>
            <p>The festival’s hybridity extended across its film program, public events and conference, industry
                pitching forum, and <a href="https://vimeo.com/693475725/1ca76c963e">INTER:ACTIVE symposium</a>, which
                this year was subtitled “The Future Belongs to Those Who Can Hear It Coming: An Inquiry Into The Future
                of the XR Industry.” The symposium was both live and livestreamed, with a multi-camera setup and clear
                audio, and also quickly made available to view on demand. After two years of enforced online attendance,
                the proliferation of options for how to engage with the event provided an interesting challenge for
                in-person attendees: should we physically attend the entire symposium, drop in on selected presentations
                and skim through the rest later, or just watch the whole thing in our hotel rooms and then come out for
                the party?</p>
            <p>The challenge of how to be hybrid also formed a theme for the day’s discussions. Various presentations
                engaged with the shift to hybrid working practices accelerated by the pandemic, and with the potential
                for XR to become a space within which the immersive nonfiction community works as well as an outcome of
                this work. For example, Annette Mees asked, “When do we need to be physically together, and how best do
                we connect when we’re physically apart?” A pertinent question, considering how small but geographically
                widely spread the immersive nonfiction community is.</p>
            <p>More interesting to me, however, was another question, asked by Vassiliki Khonsari: “Is it limiting for
                XR to be associated with film festivals?” It felt strange that such a question should be asked
                <em>at</em> a film festival. It felt as if a sub-text had inadvertently surfaced — as if, below its
                seeming self-confidence (“do we need to be here?”) another question was also being asked: “what are we
                doing here?” On the one hand, it is heartening that ever more film festivals are engaging with emergent
                technologies and welcoming the immersive community. On the other hand, it was impossible not to notice
                that at the same time that this small group of immersive creators was having its symposium, a far larger
                group of film producers and distributors was doing the real business of the festival outside. Khonsari’s
                question touched on a deeper uncertainty about how nonfiction XR defines itself in relation to the
                various distinct (and much better established) ecosystems it touches — notably documentary, art, and
                gaming. One could argue that XR visits each of these spaces without fully inhabiting them. “Where,”
                Khonsari’s question seemed to be asking, “do we belong?”

            <p>As if in response, this year’s INTER:ACTIVE exhibition, emphatically situated within visual art. Curator
                Mark Atkin’s strategy was to gather a relatively limited number of works, so as to give visitors the
                experience of a carefully curated art exhibition. Atkin called this year’s program “unfinished
                business,” and in one work this was literally the case; <strong>The Memor: Eternal Return</strong>
                (Lundahl &amp; Seitl / ScanLAB Projects Sweden, United Kingdom, 2019) had already been packed up and was
                ready to ship to the 2020 festival when the Danish borders closed.</p>
            <p>The resulting exhibition fitted with both its surroundings, the 17th century Kunsthal Charlottenborg, and
                the strong focus of CPH:DOX on artists’ moving image. In one sense, CPH:DOX INTER:ACTIVE 2022 felt like
                an art exhibition from the future — a seamlessly hybrid gallery space in which physical artefacts are no
                longer artworks in themselves, mounted on plinths to be admired, but rather tools for physical
                engagement with digital spaces and constituents of rich media artworks.</p>
            <p>This hybridity was most palpable in <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/331988008">The Memor: Eternal
                        Return</a></strong>, a combination of VR experience and one-on-one performance. At various
                times, the participant was invited to touch various artifacts within the virtual space. These
                corresponded spatially to 3D printed shapes mounted on stands in the gallery, providing the virtual
                archive with a tactile dimension. Particularly powerful were the subtly choreographed moments of touch
                between participant and performer. In this perhaps-almost-post-pandemic context, as I found myself
                touching a stranger palm-to-palm, I felt the resonance of multiple connections overlaid: between myself
                and the performer, between physical space and digital space, and between my present COVID-aware self and
                my previous, less circumspect way of being.</p>

                    class="marginnote"><strong>Liminal Lands</strong>. Courtesy of the artist</span></figure>
            <p>In line with Atkin’s aim, most works in the exhibition felt closer to digital art than nonfiction
                storytelling. For example, <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/502129027">Liminal Lands</a></strong>
                (Jakob Kudsk Steensen; France, Denmark, United States, 2021) was a spectacularly rendered process of
                continual transformation from one stylized digital/natural landscape to another. Sundance favorite
                <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gtzm-QQ9vhM">Gondwana</a></strong> (Ben Joseph Andrews,
                Australia) accelerated years of environmental degradation in the Daintree Rainforest into hours.
            </p>
            <p>Most immediately impactful was the “participatory installation” <strong><a
                        href="https://vimeo.com/534427070?embedded=true&amp;source=vimeo_logo&amp;owner=8171100">Captured</a></strong>
                (Hanna Haaslahti, Finland / Germany), in which visitors’ faces were scanned and then mapped onto the
                virtual bodies of a crowd carrying out an endless generative cycle of mob-like behavior. Haaslahti’s
                large-screen installation was craftily located at the entrance of the exhibition, and so formed a
                recurrent and unavoidable element of the exhibition experience: over an hour after I tried it out, my
                virtual double was still getting trampled by a crowd of other gallery visitors.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, however, rather than providing a foretaste of the future, the exhibition felt more like a
                flashback to the pre-pandemic past. Time and again, it reminded me of the sensory overstimulation of
                previous visits to festival-based interactive exhibitions (the multiplicity of screens, the mixing of
                sounds, the tangle of movement), as well as the sheer Panopticism of it all. In one installation, as I
                flapped my arms around in the hope of triggering some interaction, not quite knowing what I should be
                doing, I pictured my ignorance displayed in real-time to passers-by on a nearby screen.</p>

            <p>Visiting an immersive exhibition in which none of the works were available to experience online similarly
                felt like a partial return to the pre-pandemic past. CPH:DOX INTER:ACTIVE had <a
                    href="https://filmmakermagazine.com/111545-cphdox-2021-live-and-interactive/#.YlwiUC8Rpc8">a
                    remarkable online program last year</a> built around ‘live documentary’, which brilliantly showcased
                the potential of livestreaming as a filmmaking tool: it touched on possibilities that may still take
                years to work through. So it’s completely understandable that this year Atkin’s curation should
                celebrate the kinds of in-person experiences that were for so long unavailable. But the absence of an
                online immersive program was also slightly surprising, both in the context of other festivals’ recent
                immersive offerings (for example, IDFA, Sundance, and SXSW), and of the strong accessibility ethos at
                CPH:DOX. Hundreds of thousands of viewers across Denmark watched the festival’s film program. But how
                many people not already connected to the festival would dare to walk through the courtyards of this
                baroque gallery, up four flights of stairs, and through the clusters of industry power brokers, to try
                out this exhibition?</p>
            <p>One lesson from the last two years is that hybridity transcends residual binaries. Art can be physical,
                digital, or both together; it can be created and experienced in public and in private — inside, outside,
                and online. There is no zero sum game here: each is just an extra route to connecting with users.
                However, it often feels that the creative XR industry still in some ways suffers from teenage identity
                anxieties. Is it art, or is it tech? Is it in-person or online? Is it good at telling stories, or
                creating experiences? After two days immersed in the CPH:DOX INTER:ACTIVE program, I wonder whether “the
                future of the XR industry” is not one future but a multiplicity of futures. And whether, rather than
                being a weakness, XR’s fluid identity and inherent hybridity could in fact become a unique strength.</p>
