                    implications of storytelling and art at the cusp of the physical and the digital.</em></p>
            <p>“At this point, VR and AR are two of the last major technologies that haven’t faced a huge scandal
                involving genocide, mass surveillance, election tampering, or the wholesale dissolution of truth,” <a
                    href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/30/18159462/2018-tech-recap-vr-ar-virtual-augmented-reality-beat-saber-oculus-hololens-magic-leap">wrote
                </a>Andi Robertson for <em>The Verge</em> at the cusp of the new year.</p>
            <p>Given the breakneck pace of development for new forms of digitally mediated reality, the question is: How
                soon?</p>
            <p>Not soon enough, if you’re Kevin Kelly, who <a href="https://kk.org/">bills himself</a> as “Senior
                Maverick” for <em>Wired. </em>In his claustrophobic <a
                    href="https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-ar-next-big-tech-platform/">March cover story</a>, he
                welcomes us all to “Mirrorworld” — a future place he claims is on the way, which will consist of a
                full-sized digital twin of every place and thing on earth, queued up as a “grand third platform” to
                follow the web and social media. Whoever dominates it, he writes, “will become among the wealthiest and
                most powerful people and companies in history.”</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/612/118/0*6iZX_kWxk6h9YU0P" width="612"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="18326195917256173805">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="18326195917256173805"><span class="marginnote">From Wikipedia: The
                    Reality-virtuality continuum</span></figure>
            <p>To keep things short, let’s use the term “<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality%E2%80%93virtuality_continuum">mixed reality</a>” (MR) to
                include augmented and extended reality platforms and content, plus the AI and location services often
                used in conjunction with such experiences. Contemporary MR offers rudimentary versions of this grand
                vision, suggests Kelly. In typical fashion, he notes that digitizing everything everywhere will produce
                some unforeseen problems, and probably kill a few people in the process, but in the end it’ll all be
                worth it.</p>
            <p>“We know there will be severe physiological and psychological effects of dwelling in dual worlds,” Kelly
                shrugs. “The great paradox is that the only way to understand how AR works is to build AR and test
                ourselves in it.” He also allows that to “synchronize the virtual twins of all places and all things
                with the real places and things while rendering it visible to millions — will require tracking people
                and things to a degree that can only be called a total surveillance state.”</p>
            <p>But, hey, in return we’ll get what Kelly calls a new “super power” — i.e. “super vision,” which will
                allow us to see not just the familiar tangible world, but the “virtual ghosts” of objects, and perhaps
                even the avatars of the AIs whose voices we can only hear right now. “Inside the mirrorworld, agents
                like Siri and Alexa will take on 3D forms that can see and be seen,” he predicts. “Their eyes will be
                the embedded billion eyes of the matrix.” (Paging <a
                    href="https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/jordan-peele-monkeypaw-prods-twilight-zone-us-1202903254/">Jordan
                    Peele</a>…)</p>
            <p>While Kelly waxes ecstatic about “super vision,” he’s less bullish on, well, supervision. He asserts that
                neither any government nor a “Big Brother” monopolistic corporation should mar the future he projects.
                Instead, some vague and unimagined authority will help to produce the “mechanisms in the mirror world to
                prevent fakes, stop illicit deletions, spot rogue insertions, remove spam, and reject insecure parts.”
                Maybe blockchain can solve this, he hand waves. Well, who cares, really. As long as someone gets rich!
            </p>
            <p>None of this hubris is really surprising — after all, Kelly co-founded <em>Wired</em> and writes books
                with titles such as <em>The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our
                    Future.</em> Sweeping over-generalizations and grating techno-utopianism even in the face of a
                lethal tsunami of backlash are his bread-and-butter.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, back in the real world, scholars, artists, media-makers and advocates are treading water,
                still trying to figure out how to counter the excesses of previous media forms while preparing for this
                next deluge. Out front: journalists, documentary filmmakers, designers and civic tech developers, busy
                trying to hold the line on verifiable facts, find ways to generate empathy among compassion-fatigued and
                choice-addled audience members, and create trustworthy mechanisms for engaging people in the democratic
                process.</p>
            <p>Already we’re dealing with the fallout from previous failures in media regulation and civic education: a
                president spawned by reality TV and tabloids who denigrates the press, and a digital public sphere
                distorted by bots, hackers and trolls. Attempts to provide media literacy training to help citizens
                decipher twenty-first century forms of information assume incorrectly that they’ve already mastered
                basic twentieth-century skills of literacy and numeracy. Now, how will yet another layer of reality —
                virtual, mixed, augmented or whatever — further tangle everyone’s perceptions?</p>
            <p>Here at <em>Immerse</em>, we tend to take an optimistic view of new technologies, seeing them as
                opportunities for creativity, self-expression, organizing, and connection. But — real talk — both U.S.
                and global media activists need some rapid-response methods for forging standards, practices, and policy
                remedies posthaste. While we’re still busy trying to save journalism and regulate Facebook, MR devices
                and apps are creeping into people’s everyday habits, changing the ways they conceptualize the world
                around them, form their own identities, interpret evidence, and create social bonds. The advent of 5G
                connectivity is going to <a
                    href="https://medium.com/vr-first/a-summary-of-augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-market-size-predictions-4b51ea5e2509">turbocharge
                    these technologies</a>.</p>
            <p>A recent conference I attended at Penn celebrating the launch of the <a
                    href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/news/mic-center-launch-recap">Media, Inequality and
                    Change</a> (MIC) center reveals the contours of the social and policy issues raised by <em>any</em>
                new set of media and communications tools. There are issues of localism vs. consolidation; the status
                and treatment of media workers; concerns about obscenity, libel, and outright lying; balancing of market
                freedom against the public interest. There are the carrots — how do we create incentives, networks,
                infrastructure, and funding to support public-interest news, storytelling, educational content, and
                community organizing — and the sticks to punish and wrest concessions from the companies, moguls, and
                bad actors who are <a
                    href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/january-february-march-2019/the-world-is-choking-on-digital-pollution/">polluting
                    our public sphere</a>.</p>
            <p>There’s no need to reinvent the wheel here — the very same companies currently under the microscope for
                <a
                    href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/02/facebook-is-a-law-breaking-digital-gangster-uk-government-report-says/">violating
                    users’ privacy</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/2/13/18222498/apple-news-publisher-deal-50-percent-lol">shredding
                    journalistic marketplaces</a> via their social platforms and digital services are the ones
                dominating the emerging MR marketplace. Pick your target: the “FAANG” corporations
                (Facebook/Apple/Amazon/Netflix/Google) or the “Big Nine” that futurist Amy Webb writes about in her <a
                    href="https://amywebb.io/books">latest book</a> (subtract Netflix and add Alibaba, Baidu, Microsoft,
                Tencent, and IBM.) These powerful global companies are busy building proprietary platforms, gadgets,
                services, and experiences that will underpin the MR content creation and distribution for years to come.
                We need to pay attention to this now rather than waiting for new huge scandals to force us into
                reaction.

            <p>When it comes to funding better alternatives, in the U.S., some of this work in the immersive media arena
                is already taking place within established public broadcasting and public access organizations — which
                were funded via previous policy interventions. Take, for example, the recent announcement that <a
                    href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/pbs-pov-spark-announces-immersive-films-instagram-stories-1203190615/">POV
                    just launched Spark</a>, a new unit that produces interactive/immersive experiences. The Brookline
                Interactive Group — a media arts center “rooted in the tradition of public access television” — has
                pivoted to training community members how to make VR/XR, and, unlike many less inventive peer
                organizations, is healthy and <a href="https://publicvrlab.squarespace.com/career">growing</a>. Black
                Public Media has also gone all in on VR and other new technologies, launching a <a
                    href="https://blackpublicmedia.org/360-incubator-fund/">360 Incubator</a> and hosting a BPM+
                screening series to highlight black creatives producing in this space.</p>
            <p>For the most part, though, it has proven difficult to force legacy public media organizations to invent
                or invest in new ways of making media. One bright note: a <a
                    href="https://www.storythings.com/the-public-media-stack-summit">recent summit</a> organized by Matt
                Locke of Storythings aimed to reconceive a “public media stack,” which would provide “a sustainable
                ecosystem of ethical, independent technologies without exploiting the data, content, or relationships
                that are critical [to such projects].” There, developers, producers and wonks gamely rolled up their
                sleeves to map out 130+ software products currently being used to create, distribute, collaborate
                around, or evaluate digital media—and to speed-write a new definition for the new forms of “public
                media” these tools enable.</p>

            <p>But other countries are already much further ahead both in terms of laying down rules for digital
                platforms (<a

                    better or worse</a>) and investing in emerging content. The National Film Board of Canada has long
                been a leading funder and incubator of <a href="https://www.nfb.ca/interactive/">incredible media
                    experiments</a>, for example, and the UK is funding <a
                    href="https://www.immerseuk.org/news/immersive-economy-in-the-uk-report-launches/">R&amp;D</a> in
                virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technologies. Finland is <a
                    href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/05/europe/finland-fake-news-intl/">going gangbusters</a>
                on digital literacy training. At the MIC center event, I picked up <em><a
                        href="https://www.mediareform.org.uk/blog/media-manifesto-2019">Media Manifesto 2019: A Media
                        Policy Fit for the 21st Century</a></em><em>—</em>a progressive vision for even more sweeping
                and future-facing reforms in the UK.</p>
            <p>In short, the U.S. is lagging in media policy and public funding for MR and adjacent media experiments.
                This puts us at both a moral and a competitive disadvantage. As Kelly suggests, there’s no getting out
                of the fact that we are all going to have to reckon with the consequences of mixing reality in new and
                disruptive ways. So what can we do together to rapidly devise a better way through?</p>
