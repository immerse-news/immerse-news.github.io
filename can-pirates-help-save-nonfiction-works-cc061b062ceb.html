                    cinephiles</span></figure>
            <p>The circulation of nonfiction films online exists in both commercial and bootleg forms. Addressing the
                former, in February 2022, 16 independent filmmakers announced that they had formed <a
                    href="http://missingmovies.org/">Missing Movies</a>, a working group dedicated to advancing the
                cause of preservation for films in danger of being left behind. They are specifically concerned with
                titles that have fallen through the gaps in the current entertainment landscape, which promises
                unlimited choice via streaming platforms but in fact offers less than what one could prospectively find
                at a video store during the heyday of VHS. As <a
                    href="http://missingmovies.org/the-missing-movies-manifesto/">the group’s manifesto</a> puts it,
                “Thousands of movies are either completely lost or are deemed too small to warrant the expense, and thus
                are completely unavailable. This is especially true of work created by women and people of color. As a
                result, we end up with a skewed history of filmmaking and crucial gaps in our cultural knowledge and
                legacy.”</p>
            <p>To drive this point home, the group offers <a href="http://missingmovies.org/list-of-missing-movies/">a
                    preliminary list</a> (they’ve promised to expand it) of films that are both out of print and
                unavailable on any streaming service. Notable entries include acclaimed works like Ossie Davis’s
                <em>Black Girl </em>(1972), Elaine May’s <em>The Heartbreak Kid </em>(1972), and Mira Nair’s
                <em>Mississippi Masala </em>(1991). (As a sign of how quickly these winds can shift, <em>Mississippi
                    Masala </em>is finally getting a restoration and <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/07/missing-movies-streaming-initiative">will soon
                    be</a> on the Criterion Channel.) The group does not make any special mention of documentary, but
                lists nonfiction films such as <em>Ali, the Fighter</em> (William Greaves, 1975), <em>The Memory of
                    Justice </em>(Marcel Ophuls, 1976), <em>Home of the Brave </em>(Laurie Anderson, 1986), and <em>Eat
                    the Document </em>(D.A. Pennebaker and Bob Dylan, 1972).
            </p>
            <p>As docs are relatively sparse among the high-profile restoration efforts in recent years, the need for
                such archival work in this field is <a
                    href="https://www.filmpreservation.org/preservation-basics/why-preserve-film">even more
                    pressing</a>. The sobering case of <em><a
                        href="https://www.docnyc.net/news/case-study-on-savedocs-eyes-on-the-prize/">Eyes on the
                        Prize</a></em><em>, </em>a seminal educational series only partially restored and available
                because of rights issues, is instructive. The few notable recent nonfiction re-releases, like 1959’s
                <em>Jazz on a Summer’s Day, </em>1972’s<em> F.T.A., </em>and 1972’s <em>Nationtime,</em> were supervised
                by <a href="https://indiecollect.org/">IndieCollect</a>, which is dedicated to precisely the kinds of
                films Missing Movies seeks to champion.
            </p>
            <h3 id="b601">The Alternative Is Karagarga and Its Bootleg Networks</h3>
            <p>And yet, there <em>is</em> one way to digitally access most of the documentaries on Missing Movies’ list.
                If you are a member of the torrenting site Karagarga, a quick search will bring you Anderson’s concert
                film, or Ophuls’s epic meditation on the cultural trauma of war, among many thousands of other titles.
                There is a small learning curve to the operation of a torrenting client (and one should probably also
                use a VPN as well), but once you get the hang of it, it’s easier than navigating most corporate
                streaming platforms. Unlike many torrenting communities, “KG,” as it’s known, <a
                    href="https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/weekend-post/karagarga-and-the-vulnerability-of-obscure-films">maintains
                    a high standard for file quality</a> and specifically curates a selection of rare, foreign, and
                otherwise obscure films.</p>
            <p>While KG’s membership is <a
                    href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zmd4ea/forget-netflix-inside-the-forums-where-people-share-obscure-pirated-movies">exclusive</a>,
                a wider network of cinephiles has grown around it on social media, especially on Twitter. You might not
                have a KG membership, but you might know someone who does, or someone who knows someone. It’s possible
                to take advantage of KG through a complex series of negotiations by finding out what files are
                available, who has which, or who can get what. (In order to keep data flow at a reasonable rate, every
                KG member operates under restrictions for how much they can download, so no one can simply obtain
                hundreds of titles on a whim.) In a similar manner, certain Twitter users will post timed links to <a
                    href="https://mega.io/">MEGA</a> folders containing files for download. (This is how I recently
                obtained over two-dozen otherwise impossible-to-find Tsai Ming-liang shorts.) This community, entirely
                ad hoc and homegrown, has created a kind of stochastic, crowdsourced form of archival practice.</p>
            <p>I spoke with one prolific MEGA uploader who is also studying film preservation and archiving in grad
                school. According to her analysis, “Torrent infrastructure has some really interesting implications from
                an archival perspective. Allowing files to be decentralized, existing in identical form on a number of
                different systems, is to me their most significant benefit. It requires a lot of trust in users to
                maintain those files, but if you can manage that, you’ve got the potential for a whole lot of backups.”
            </p>
            <h3 id="9edc">Justifying the Risk</h3>
            <p>The one hitch, beyond securing a hard-to-get invitation to more exclusive trackers like KG, is that none
                of this is, strictly speaking, legal. While it’s unlikely that any high-powered lawyers are on the hunt
                for people obtaining copies of films whose rights have mostly lapsed, piracy may be an uncomfortable
                prospect on basic ethical or moral grounds, particularly when it comes to works that have some level of
                availability. In her book <em>Ten Skies, </em>Erika Balsom admits that the only way she could watch the
                titular film by James Benning over and over to analyze it was to pirate it:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Ultimately, seeing something is better than not seeing anything. When I mentioned to Benning, not
                    without some hesitation, that I had found the film on YouTube, his response was, ‘Sharing is
                    caring.’ He seemed fine — happy, even — that it was out there. The bootleg offers a degraded form of
                    access, sure, an experience of unabashedly inferior quality, yes. I doubt anyone would come away
                    from watching it with the feeling of having had a powerful aesthetic experience. Yet its value is
                    not to be dismissed entirely…</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>For rarer films, in many cases, if they were not being pirated, they would not be getting seen at all. As
                my source put it, “These sites save films that have no shot at mainstream release, often going so far as
                to subtitle non-English work that would never get official translations. There is no archiving without
                accessibility… I have seen so many films I love because someone took the time to share it with other
                people when no one else would, and to keep it safe when it might otherwise disappear. To me, that’s the
                archival spirit in action.”</p>
            <p>The existence of this “archival spirit” is a particularly vital question for interactive nonfiction.
                Frequently, such works are impossible to access after they’ve made their rounds through film festivals
                and museum installations. If they aren’t put on marketplaces like Steam (where they are frequently <a
                    href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/4/13507754/project-syria-steam">misunderstood by users</a>),
                how can they be distributed? Obviously, there are additional technical considerations around equipment,
                file formats, etc. But appreciators might do well to look to the example set by the
                Karagarga/Twitter/MEGA community, which found ways to circumvent their own obstacles to create a
                thriving corner of the internet where rare works are kept alive.</p>
