            <p>When we have editorial meetings at <em>Immerse</em> and discuss the people we would like to invite to
                write or feature in some way, we always end up with long lists of really extraordinary people,
                organizations and collectives. I thought it would be a nice idea to start a regular feature where we
                shine a light on some of the people and groups that inspire us, partly as a path of discovery for
                ourselves because as always we welcome suggestions, particularly from parts of the world we might not be
                knowledgeable about. <a href="mailto:editor@immerse.news">Let us know</a> who inspires you in emerging
                media/digital arts/whatever you call the space you are in.</p>
            <p>So without further ado, here are this month’s five we like:</p>
            <h3 id="fff8"><a href="https://twitter.com/digitalafrican">Jepchumba</a></h3>
            <p>Kenyan-based Jepchumba is a powerhouse curator and speaker and the woman behind the wonderful website <a
                    href="http://africandigitalart.com">African Digital Art</a>, an incredibly rich celebration of art,
                design, and technology in Africa. If you are looking to find out who is making exciting work in Africa,

            <h3 id="c114"><a href="https://grayarea.org">Gray Area Foundation for the Arts</a></h3>
            <p>Gray Area just completed its <a href="https://grayareafestival.io/">fourth annual festival</a> showcasing
                groundbreaking art and technology. Based in San Francisco and founded <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/JosetteMelchor">by Josette Melchor</a>, Gray Area runs an incubator, a
                series of classes, and exciting events that are truly interdisciplinary and focused on community and
                positive social impact.</p>

            <h3 id="47a2"><a href="https://twitter.com/monikabielskyte">Monika Bielskyte</a></h3>
            <p>A nomadic futurist, Monika Bielskyte prototypes culturally diverse, socially and environmentally engaged
                future world designs. She is a co-founder of ALLFUTUREEVERYTHING, an agency &amp; a platform for
                prototyping futures. She travels constantly, often in the Global South, so she’s truly global in her
                outlook and future imaginations, always with a humanitarian focus and avoiding both nostalgia and
                techno-fetishism. Bielskyte is trying to help us avoid living the dystopian nightmares of so much sci-fi
                pop culture. And, as she reminds us, the future is now. What we do now, and what we look away from,
                shape the future.</p>

            <h3 id="ab47"><a href="http://www.hyphen-labs.com">Hyphen-Labs</a></h3>
            <p>Hyphen-Labs is an international team of women of color working at the intersection of technology, art,
                science, and the future, working collaboratively across the globe: “[W]e all wore a bunch of different
                hats. We gave each other feedback on the pieces that we each sort of owned, but there was a lot of
                cross-pollination of ideas and skillsets. We all had to learn stuff that we didn’t know how to do, very
                quickly.” Research is a big part of the group’s methodology, as <a
                    href="https://docubase.mit.edu/lab/interviews/by-htm/">this interview</a> makes clear. Hyphen-Labs
                is behind the award-winning <em>NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism</em>, which premiered at Sundance and was
                recently released on the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/go/1934075829959225/">Oculus
                    Store</a>.</p>

            <h3 id="f272"><a href="https://lessgoodidea.com/">Centre for the Less Good Idea</a></h3>
            <p>An interdisciplinary incubator for the arts founded by artist William Kentridge and based in
                Johannesburg, South Africa. The center creates a space for ideas at the edge of things and embraces
                failure in all the right ways: “It is a safe space for failure, for projects to be tried and discarded
                because they do not work. It’s a space for short form work which doesn’t have a natural home in a
                theatre or gallery.” On a related note, watch Kentridge’s <a

                    from Design Indaba</a> on peripheral thinking.</p>
