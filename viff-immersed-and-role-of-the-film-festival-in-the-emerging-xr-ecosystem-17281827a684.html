            <p><em>by Brian Seth Hurst and Caitlin Burns</em></p>
            <p>In December of 2014, Samsung introduced the <a
                    href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/samsung-gear-vr-innovator-edition">Gear VR
                    Innovator Edition</a>. It was the culmination of years of hope and hype the signaled the birth of a
                new medium. This would change the language of filmmaking: the way stories were told and the ways
                audiences experienced those stories forever. At least, that was the promise.</p>
            <p>As veterans of the “new media” side of the entertainment industry, we are also veterans of the hype cycle
                that goes with the introduction of emerging technology — from interactive television, to webvideo, to
                “mobisodes,” “transmedia,” and 3D TV. Some hits. Some misses. Some millionaires. Some bankruptcies.
                Innovation marches on.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>“Some hits. Some misses. Some millionaires. Some bankruptcies. Innovation marches
                        on.”</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>There is a value chain from idea to reality in entertainment innovation. First comes investment in the
                technology. Then the technology — in the case of virtual reality, the head-mounted display (HMD), the
                compute power, the cameras… then the content creators… and then, hopefully, the audience.</p>
            <p>That link to the audience is reminiscent of what they used to call “the last mile” in fiber-optic
                technology — a serious challenge. If you’ve been in the business of new media long enough, you know how
                hard it is to explain why a groundbreaking new experience is going to change the way people see the
                world. It’s even harder to get audiences to agree with you that seeing the world in this new way is
                something they’d want. Explaining an immersive piece verbally is about as effective as dancing about
                architecture. Now do that for the entire global audience.</p>

            <p>Only now, after 5 years, is the dearth of great VR content beginning to change, moving from novelty to
                filmmaking. But since those early days the category has expanded and virtual reality has become a subset
                of what has come to be called the “immersive industry” and comes under the banner “XR,” which includes
                mixed reality (MR), augmented reality (AR), immersive domes and so much more.</p>
            <p>Unlike 5 years ago, there <em>is</em> a distribution ecosystem, including in-home, out-of-home
                (location-based entertainment), and head-mounted displays in MR, such as those iterations from Oculus,
                HTC, Samsung, Playstation VR, Microsoft, and Magic Leap mobile AR. There are even independent
                distribution platforms such as Littlstar and VeerVR. <strong>Those distributors can connect a piece to a
                    pre-existing global audience.</strong></p>
            <p>Sure, enterprise applications for training, real estate, and spatial computing continue to develop in
                medicine, architecture, education, travel, and customer service. Production companies have found that
                enterprise work can keep them afloat. It’s not as glamorous, but the experience still allows for
                innovation in storytelling.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>There remain two great challenges to creators of immersive entertainment: funding and consumer
                    pick-up</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>First, Funding.</strong></p>
            <p>When the reality of Virtual Reality hit, what little funding there was, seemed to dry up. At the same
                time, the production companies and professionals that didn’t plan ahead for the long game disappeared.
                Many in the industry declared 2018 the year of the “trough of disillusionment.” It’s easy to believe.
                Unlike new media revolutions of the last 10 years, immersive entertainment is not making an art more
                accessible, cheaper to create, easier to access, or reducing the skill level required to make it well.
                Quite the opposite. These fields require collaboration, are intense productions, are still developing,
                and require significant time and budgets to bring to life.</p>
            <p>Luckily for everyone, plenty of creative teams are pushing through the trough, and innovation continues.
                Distribution platforms are more dedicated to VR gaming, but the content library for cinematic VR,
                animation, and documentary continues to grow. Creators can still find government technology and content
                funding in countries such as Canada, France, the UK, and China. As a matter of fact, <a
                    href="https://vrroom.buzz/vr-news/business/chinas-master-plan-lead-vr-2025">XR is a major area in
                    the Chinese Government’s master plan</a>.The national and local governments support immersive
                technology, content and distribution. Work is now being created that is at the same level of quality as
                major film and television releases, from teams all over the world, even as they are developing their own
                fundraising and business models and working with brands to finance their growth.</p>
            <p>It’s as hard to make immersive content now as it was for independent filmmakers in the early 1990s, and
                for independent game companies in the early 2000s. But many creators are not scared off by a challenge.

            <p><strong>But where are the audiences?</strong></p>
            <p>We still haven’t made it to the mass adoption era of the technology curve. It’s a slow build that is now,
                like any premium service, requiring consumer investment of money and time, dependent on the quality of
                the content, including games, narrative and interactive narrative, and a continued flow of that content.
            </p>
            <p>XR technologies have relied on the “If you build it, they will come” mentality when it comes to
                developing creator teams, content, and audiences. The platforms (Facebook’s Oculus, Google, and HTC)
                actually founded their own content studios,<a
                    href="https://uploadvr.com/wolves-in-the-walls-and-age-of-sail-win-2019-emmys/"> making significant
                    investments in award-winning content</a>. But <a

                    internal divisions have been re-focused</a> on younger, hotter, newer media trends.</p>
            <p><strong>The role of film festivals</strong></p>
            <p>Film festivals recognized a few years ago that they needed to highlight and be part of the immersive
                revolution. Curators brought unique content experiences to festival-goers. Much of the content was based
                on installations, one-of-a-kind experiences that could only be seen and experienced by attendees. While
                some of that content found distribution on a handful of services, the majority of the content was not
                available for audiences beyond the festival.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Part of the goal of showcasing at a film festival is to get a distribution deal.</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Traditionally, film festivals present creators with the opportunity for distribution. Part of the goal of
                showcasing at a film festival is to get a distribution deal.</p>
            <p>While the industry is still working to establish solid business models and ROI on the content side, it
                cannot do so without quality content. At this time, the quality is better than it has ever been allowing
                such content to take its place alongside traditional forms such as television and film as a viable and
                transformative storytelling medium.</p>
            <p>We’ve both advised and consulted for major companies and institutions, but when we connected with the
                Vancouver International Film Festival (VIFF) we finally found a team that wanted to bring some of the
                strongest commercial tools for content available for film and tv creators to the immersive landscape.
            </p>
            <p>The executive team at the festival — led by experts who had helped catalyze Alberta’s film and television
                industry as well as the incredible Production-Gaming-Animation-VFX mecca that Vancouver has become,
                heard our concerns and wanted to ensure that there is a place for work aimed at commercial distribution
                to truly thrive.</p>
            <p>In 2017, Jacqueline Dupuis, the executive director of the <a href="https://viff.org">Vancouver
                    International Film Festival</a> approached StoryTech® Immersive (S/I) to assist in the production of
                a virtual reality conference track and a limited exhibition of content. We agreed, and “VIFF VR” was
                born. As producers of immersive content, both cinematic and live, we saw in that first year an
                opportunity as producers to build a conference of relevant case studies for content creators. According
                to the <a href="https://www.thevrara.com/vancouver-chapter">VRARA</a>, Vancouver is the number two XR
                ecosystem in the world. What was a relatively small initiative resonated with festival attendees and the
                Vancouver VR community.</p>

            </figure>
            <p><strong>The birth of VIFF Immersed</strong></p>
            <p>In 2018, as the industry had some growing pains, we all agreed it was time for some serious conversation
                and collaboration. We decided to build a solid strategic foundation for extending the Vancouver
                International Film Festival brand into the world of XR and VIFF Immersed was launched. It needed to be a
                different sort of festival for content creators — we wanted them to have not just the opportunity for
                exhibition but for commercial distribution to the world.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>The opportunity: to connect phenomenal narrative work with the available at-home
                        audiences.</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Our focus was on work that could be delivered to audiences both at home and in location-based
                entertainment environments. We decided that VIFF Immersed would focus on content that was already in —
                or would be available for — commercial distribution to mass audiences. It was also decided to develop
                VIFF Immersed as an international market initiative to support development, production, and
                distribution.</p>
            <p><strong>VIFF Immersed 2019</strong></p>
            <p>Now in its second year, <a href="https://viff.org/Online/immersed">VIFF Immersed </a>continues to extend
                the Vancouver International Film Festival’s mission of “celebrating excellence in screen-based
                storytelling” with a robust program initiative, which includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>New Realities in Storytelling: </strong>a high-level conference day focused on creators’
                    work and insights from distributors about what they’re actually looking to connect with audiences.
                </li>
                <li><strong>International VIFF Immersed Competition:</strong> a contest that requires story-driven
                    submissions be already in or available for commercial distribution. More than 90 eligible
                    submissions from 30 countries were received in the categories of cinematic VR, documentary, and
                    animation. Those entrants selected as finalists evidence the evolution of XR content allowing the
                    work to be judged by the same standards applied to traditional film in terms of story and
                    production.</li>
                <li><strong>VIFF Immersed Public Exhibition: </strong>a showcase of story-driven virtual reality
                    productions in live action, animation, and documentary. In addition to showcasing the finalists in
                    competition, there is a curated selection of stand-out British Columbian content: the “BC
                    Showcase”<strong> </strong>sponsored by Creative BC, and freestanding installations at festival
                    locations showcasing the work of independent Canadian creators presented by the Canadian Council.
                </li>
                <li><strong>BC Immersed: </strong>a day of hands-on workshops in all aspects of immersive production for
                    filmmakers and their teams. This day is also aimed at connecting local creators with international
                    teams to network, learn, and find new collaborators.</li>
                <li><strong>The BC Tech Crawl: </strong>developed for buyers, distributors, and producers from other
                    countries to tour and present Vancouver-based immersive tech and production companies offering the
                    opportunities for co-production, content distribution, and work for hire in both entertainment and
                    enterprise. The program resonated even more deeply with the creative community, especially the
                    workshops.</li>
                <li><strong><a href="http://about.kaleidoscope.fund/viff-market">VIFF Immersed Co-Production
                            Market</a></strong><strong>: </strong>a collaboration with the Kaleidoscope Fund to connect
                    projects in development with investment, grants and co-production opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>A major marketplace initiative</strong> focusing on the state of the industry in Vancouver,
                    BC, Canada and centers of production and distribution globally will be developed and published later
                    in the year.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One of the defining features of VIFF Immersed is the intention to bring the innovative XR narrative work
                in cinematic VR, documentary and animation to audiences — not just in Canada — but globally. With this
                in mind, VIFF Immersed has established <strong>featured channels with at-home distributors </strong><a
                    href="https://www.viveport.com/">VIVEPORT </a>and <strong><a href="https://veer.tv/">VeeR
                        VR</a></strong> for the duration of VIFF 2019 (September 28 — October 13). The extension of the
                VIFF Immersed Exhibition onto these platforms gives creators an opportunity to showcase their work to
                not just audiences around the world but to investors, producers, and distributors.</p>
            <p>This year we’ll also be presenting <strong>The VIFF Immersed VeeR VR Global Audience Award,
                </strong>voted on by viewers outside of North America.</p>

            <p>Film festivals have always provided a place for new voices to be heard, new stories to be told, and new
                ways of telling those stories. With a history of more than 30 years celebrating “excellence in
                screen-based storytelling,” VIFF has been a showcase and a platform for connecting storytellers to
                audiences as well as a gateway for creators to the business of storytelling and distribution. It was
                natural for the festival to extend both its brand and mission to support the screen-based narratives
                being created in immersive media and to support the establishment and continued building of a commercial
                immersive marketplace.</p>
            <p>In a very short time, VIFF Immersed has become an essential event for XR storytellers, distributors, and
                investors and, of course, an audience longing to experience exceptional storytelling.</p>
