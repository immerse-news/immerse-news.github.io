            </blockquote>
            <p>This is the question asked in “<a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/democratize-design-86d2385865bd">Democratize Design</a>” from
                the <a href="https://makinganewreality.org">Making a New Reality</a> research project. This piece goes
                in depth about strategies for collaborative design that are focused on the active participation of
                members of society and communities that have been traditionally marginalised. I want to add to this by
                addressing what designers and developers who are creating new media can be doing right now, even if they
                don’t have the resources that can connect them to a multitude of perspectives. Building on the concepts
                discussed in both “<a href="https://makinganewreality.org/democratize-design-86d2385865bd">Democratize
                    Design</a>” and my previous piece “<a
                    href="https://virtualrealitypop.com/embodiment-and-the-boundaries-between-us-in-virtual-reality-d03ef0f25575">Embodiment
                    and the Boundaries Between Us in Virtual Reality</a>,” this article aims to construct a framework
                that can function as a catalyst for perspective shifting and reveal implicit biases in the design of
                human representation.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world
                    changing fiction.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This quote from Donna Haraway’s seminal essay “<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Cyborg_Manifesto">A Cyborg Manifesto</a>” preceded my previous
                article and I want to draw attention to it again as it effectively sums up the nature of social reality
                in relation to media design. This sentiment is echoed in “Democratize Design,” which discusses a
                strategic design approach to empower marginalised voices through envisioning potential future worlds
                know as <a href="http://worldbuilding.institute">World Building</a>:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“World Building designates a narrative practice in which the design of a world precedes the telling
                    of a story … World Building is founded on three beliefs, namely that storytelling is the most
                    powerful system for the advancement of human capability due to its ability to allow human
                    imagination to precede the realization of thought; that all stories emerge logically and intuitively
                    from the worlds that create them; and that new technologies powerfully enable us to sculpt the
                    imagination into existence.” — <em>Alex McDowell, Director of The World Building Institute</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If we think about of our individual stories in the current world, to some degree we have been conditioned
                to perform within the boundaries of dominant discourses that define the reality in which we live; a
                reality which is largely designed through media representations and their continued reiterations.</p>
            <p>“Discourses” can be thought of as narratives that adhere to certain ways of viewing and being in the
                world, which aren’t necessarily conscious but rather embedded as “common sense” in a community’s
                understanding of human experience. It is discourse that creates and/or maintains specific social power
                relations between different groups of people and once you learn to look for it in media representation,
                it becomes apparent. It is akin to learning how to read the “source code” that generates subconscious
                conditions of human relations.</p>
            <p>I have previously used the theory of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Barad">Agential
                    realism</a>,” which is rooted in physics’ notion of entanglement to reveal power relations in media
                discourse, and, while I won’t go into the details of this theory in this article, I will borrow a few
                points that are valuable for designers and developers to use in understanding the discourses being
                channeled through their work.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>“Accountability and responsibility must be thought of in terms of what matters and what is excluded
                    from mattering” (Barad, 2007, p 392).</li>
                <li>The nature of materiality itself is an entanglement that always demands an “other” (p 392). In the
                    example of able-bodied and disabled individuals; both of these types of embodiment depend on the
                    other for their very definition and hence existence (p 158). The same can be said for any type of
                    othering: people of colour and white people, women and men, homosexual and heterosexual, etc. The
                    very definition of these labels relies on their others for meaning and for a power-relation to exist
                    in the first place. Inhabiting a combination of these labels develops identity and our performance
                    towards each other through our identities is responsible for generating the power balances of our
                    relations.</li>
                <li>“Differentiating should not be a process of othering or separating, but on the contrary about making
                    connections and commitments” (p 392).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So how can we understand these points in relation to designing for inclusivity?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>We must reflect on our design choices and ask: “What matters and what is excluded from mattering?”
                    and question ourselves as to why this is the case. Taking <strong>responsibility</strong> for our
                    work is all about our <strong>ability to respond</strong> to other perspectives.</li>
                <li>Our own existence and identity is connected to everyone else’s and the ways in which identities are
                    portrayed in media influence the power dynamics of how we come to understand ourselves and perform
                    in relation to each other.</li>
                <li>The understanding that our identity is fundamentally reliant on others to exist should be the basis
                    of developing a design practice that makes connection the focus instead of separation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>To illustrate these points, I will present a couple of examples of contemporary design in virtual reality
                that are unintentionally still perpetuating the marginalisation of Non-European people, in spite of good
                intentions. While it is clear that media is sometimes designed for specific audiences, I have chosen
                these two examples because of their intention to connect with a wide audience.</p>
            <h3 id="00ee"><strong>The colonisation of imagination</strong></h3>
            <p><em><a href="https://www.bdh.net/immersive/wonderful-you">Wonderful You VR</a></em> is an impressive
                experience that takes the viewer right into the womb to witness the development of the five senses of a
                foetus from conception to 35 weeks. It invites the audience to “meet your unborn self,” and seeks to
                portray the wonder of human development through viewers actively imagining themselves as the developing
                foetus. This is also helped by narration that explains how “your” body is growing. The elements of
                immersive imagery, sound, music, and narration flow together showcasing virtual reality’s unique ability
                to envelop the viewer, creating a captivating and visceral storytelling experience that also serves an
                educational purpose. But…</p>

                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="7749098660315383556"><span class="marginnote">The
                    35-week-old model of a baby in the womb</span></figure>
            <p>As we have become so accustomed to when looking at media and in particular educational depictions of
                humans there is once again a standard model used to portray the wonder of human development. It’s not in
                the least surprising that the standard we are presented with is of European appearance; in fact, it is a
                given. While this VR experience is based on cutting-edge science, if we for a moment assume the role of
                designer, let us ask the question: what matters and what is excluded from mattering in this experience?
            </p>
            <p>In regards to a factual medical representation of non-European babies in the womb, it is not a question
                of clear skin tone differences, due to melanin mainly kicking in after birth. However, other options of
                human appearance are nevertheless excluded. This chosen “norm” is a familiar one used over and over in
                media, and whether consciously or not, it is actually based on members of society considered to be a
                socio-economic priority.</p>
            <p>A model of a 35-week-old human baby could easily be represented with different features such as thicker
                lips, broader nostrils, Asiatic eye shape, dark eyes or a full head of hair. If this model were
                represented in another way, would it be considered too exclusionary to expect white audiences to use
                their imagination as prescribed by the marketing tag to “meet your unborn self”? Or does it always have
                to be Non-European people that are called on to develop and then continuously use an aspirational
                imagination in order to see an image of themselves in a white body?</p>
            <p>And while this major design choice may be an unconscious one that just follows the “common sense” of a
                historically recognized “norm”, the discourse defined by this choice is ironically further pushed in the
                marketing campaign under the guise of diversity. The marketing of <em>Wonderful You VR</em> includes a
                <a href="https://vimeo.com/247784012">video</a> of people of diverse appearance experiencing and then
                describing their thoughts about the importance of this VR work. The specific use of these people is a
                central device for prescribing the “normality” of the baby’s singular representation. This works to
                nullify any thoughts of exclusion while still maintaining the underlying narrative of what type of human
                is more important in society. By once again asking the question, “What matters and what is excluded from
                mattering?” we can see the colonisation of imagination at work.
            </p>
            <p>Design cannot continue to remain a zero-sum game, where in order for a human to be represented, some
                people are recognised while others are not. The work of new media creators has the potential to be
                widely distributed across many countries and, given the increasingly diverse makeup of contemporary
                societies, we cannot meaningfully “speak” to a wide audience by only representing a certain group. While
                establishing a “standard” or “norm” is the easiest option technically, it is always going to leave many
                behind, therefore also creating a narrative of social relation. As creators we must put more energy into
                thinking laterally given the multitude of new design possibilities available through ever emerging
                technology. Inclusive representation matters, and it should no longer be considered an impossible task.
            </p>
            <h3 id="b427"><strong>A story of social relation</strong></h3>
            <p>My second example shows just how deeply embedded dominant discourses are in our psyches and how they can
                continue to function even in the case of seemingly inclusive design.</p>
            <p><a href="https://altvr.com">AltspaceVR</a> is a pioneering social space in virtual reality. Its tagline
                is “be there together” and it offers both human and robot avatars for people to inhabit. AltspaceVR
                describes itself as having a <a href="https://altvr.com/new-avatars/">“whimsical”</a> visual style and
                as such the avatars follow this light-hearted approach to representation.</p>
            <p>The human avatar line is simple and presents users with a standard male and female model whose skin tone,
                hair colour and outfits can be changed according to the user’s preference. However, these are the only
                things that users can change within the frame of a standard model that closely follows socio-historical
                preferences of the western world, i.e. slim body types, women with straight hair and child-like
                features. My previous <a
                    href="https://virtualrealitypop.com/embodiment-and-the-boundaries-between-us-in-virtual-reality-d03ef0f25575">article</a>
                goes further into a critical analysis of AltspaceVR’s human avatars, but in this article, I would like
                to focus specifically on the layout of their avatar selection menu. This menu follows an exclusive
                “common sense” that designers can easily perpetuate without realising.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/608/353/1*I2jB57eK6j0meg2bVbinvA.jpeg"
                    width="608"><label class="margin-toggle" for="15876720652559278875">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="15876720652559278875"><span class="marginnote">The human
                    avatar selection menus in AltspaceVR at the time of writing this article</span></figure>
            <p>The first thing one notices when looking at AltspaceVR’s human avatar selection menu is that as well as a
                standard model of human there is also a default of skin tone and hair colour. So, what matters and what
                is excluded from mattering in this case? The underlying narrative of having a default is the assumption
                of what is normal. Considering that AltspaceVR is a virtual social space where people from around world
                can “be there together,” would it be so strange to imagine the default model having brown skin and black
                hair?</p>
            <p>Once again, we find that this is actually zero-sum identity territory. Despite the identity choices
                presented, the layout further instills a hierarchy and subsequently a narrative of who is the more
                important. While this may be a visual “common sense” of neatly positioning colours from light to dark,
                it would also be just as neat in a dark to light order. The hair colour menu is interesting because as
                well as laying out colours from light to dark it also positions the grey hair option right at the end.
                If it went by true light to dark logic then grey would actually be in the first position. The apparent
                visual rationality of this ordered presentation clearly makes room for disruption, so that it can also
                fit within a broader logic concerning the relevance of older people in social environments.</p>
            <p>Humans learn to understand the world through order, so while these design choices may seem harmless at
                first, our brains function to draw connections about reality through orders presented. And when specific
                orders are repeated continuously everywhere in the media they eventually become an unquestioning “common
                sense.”</p>
            <h3 id="62c4"><strong>Addressing the elephant in the room</strong></h3>
            <p>In both of the above examples, despite creators being inclusive-minded the reiteration of certain design
                “common senses” continues to preserve the very boundaries that are trying to be broken. This article is
                not about making a negative case against certain creators; rather, it is about revealing how easily we
                can all be complicit in perpetuating a divisive and hierarchical story of being human without even
                realising.</p>
            <p>To combat this, here are some key points that designers and developers can use in addressing unconscious
                issues of exclusion in human representation:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Asking the question, <em>“What matters and what is excluded from mattering?”</em> during your design
                    process is a useful tool, as it can help to reveal socially conditioned biases that are hiding in
                    plain sight.</li>
                <li>Make a list of the inclusions and exclusions in your work and write down the reasons for them. Think
                    about the logic behind them.</li>
                <li>Where exclusions seem inevitable due to deadlines, budget, or technical limitations discuss them
                    openly in regards to what kind of social hierarchy they may be promoting. Don’t just pretend they
                    don’t exist.</li>
                <li>Think about your use of inclusive language when marketing your work and whether this accurately
                    describes what your design offers. Glossing over issues only adds to the problem of exclusion in
                    society.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Having the courage to disclose uncomfortable truths and have discussions openly can create new spaces for
                inventive thinking. If enough creators take part in openly deconstructing their work, a cultural shift
                can take place—hence, making united awareness and effort in solving social representation a key feature
                of new media design culture.</p>
            <h3 id="43ae"><strong>Connection through design</strong></h3>
            <p>Developing a design practice of representation based on connection rather than separation can also begin
                with focusing on the affordances that new media bring, which can help clear the historical “common
                senses” of order maintained by 2D design.</p>
            <p>In the case of virtual reality, users have the potential to both view and handle 3D objects, which
                creates new scope for interactive interfaces allowing the concept of “selection” to be free of specific
                arrangements. For example, one idea could connect skin colour selection directly to 3D colour
                visualization. Visualizing colour in a non-hierarchical way has long been part of computer science and
                the film and television post-production toolset, and VR has the ability to adopt this concept in a
                unique way to make a tangible non-hierarchical ‘selection’ experience.</p>

            <p>Users could grab and select colour through a customised 3D colour space that has various colours flowing
                into each other. This colour space could be represented in the form of a cube, polyhedron, or sphere
                that floats and spins without any hierarchical up and down or left and right.</p>
            <p>A possible basis for developing an educational experience with more inclusive depictions of humans could
                also being with a 3D sphere. Perhaps a model of the earth could allow users to select their ancestral
                lineage by holding it in their hands. This could also be a timely reason to play around with how we are
                taught to perceive the earth, considering that there is no up and down in space contrary to the image of
                the earth we all know, which is also historically imbued with social hierarchy in relation to the
                north/south, east/west divide.</p>
            <p>These are just some rough jumping off points for connective design thinking in 3D space, inspired by the
                previously discussed examples. However, completely functional inclusive design that fits within a
                specific creative vision inevitably takes time and costs money. This is the crossroads where new media
                stands, and what we put value on now will play a major role in how future generations perceive each
                other. For too long media design has propagated the marginalisation of certain people through visual
                order, which has colonised our subconscious understanding of ourselves in relation to each other.</p>
            <p>As designers and developers, we are active participants in constructing a new era in global human
                communication, so even if we lack the time and funds, taking responsibility for the work we can afford
                to make is nevertheless important. Being honest and uncovering uncomfortable truths of exclusion that do
                exist is a good starting point, so that our imaginations can be freed of old-fashioned stories and we
                can move forward together, aware and with greater control over the story of social reality to come.</p>
