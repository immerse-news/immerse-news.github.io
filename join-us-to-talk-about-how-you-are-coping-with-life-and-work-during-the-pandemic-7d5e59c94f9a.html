            <p>Dear Immerse community,</p>
            <p>As we all retreat into our individual homes to self- isolate while also being inundated with updates
                about the growing severity of the COVID-19 threat, we can agree that the need for community is even
                stronger than usual.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/533/1*mO5MGFOKbRGN4Y4FJfwGGg.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>That’s why we are opening up a Slack channel for all of us to begin talking about how this crisis is
                affecting our work and livelihoods.</p>
            <p>To join our public Slack conversation, visit<a href="http://bit.ly/joinimmersenow">
                    bit.ly/joinimmersenow</a>. The page will ask you for your email address and then send you an email
                to confirm your account or to create a new Slack account if you don’t already have one.</p>
            <p>There are so many implications, and so many new questions about how we will conduct our lives and our
                work online. Who better to talk through your fears and hopes, share ideas and silly thoughts with than
                the <em>Immerse</em> community — a talented, forward-thinking, and compassionate group who understands
                the need and potential for digital platforms?</p>
            <p>We’ll start with a conversation about how we are coping during the pandemic. We look forward to being in
                discussion with you.</p>
            <p>We hope to see you there! Stay safe and strong.</p>
            <p>With much love,</p>
            <p>The Immerse Team</p>
