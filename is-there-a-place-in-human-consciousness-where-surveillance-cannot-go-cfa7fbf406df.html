            <h3 id="0a75">Noor: a Brain Opera</h3>
            <p><em>Noor: A Brain Opera</em> is an opera where a performer wearing a wireless EEG headset triggers
                videos, a sonic environment, and a libretto with her brainwaves. The results are displayed in live-time
                as she interacts with audience members within the confines of a 360-degree immersive theatre. Premiering
                in 2016, it was the first performance of its kind.</p>

            <p>I conceived and directed the work, and framed its theme around the rhetorical question: <em>“</em>Is
                there a place in human consciousness where surveillance cannot go?” Through sound, images, and spoken
                narrative, the opera presented the true story of the life of Noor Inayat Khan, a Sufi Muslim Princess
                and covert British operative inside Nazi-occupied France who was murdered at Dachau.</p>
            <p>It touched upon issues of memory, faith, and the locus of self in light of increasingly invasive and
                sophisticated surveillance technologies. The performance also worked with the bodies of both the
                performer and participants by creating a responsive feedback loop in which the performer’s interactions
                with the audience — through movement, gaze, touch, and speech — visibly changed the performer’s
                brainwaves. During the event, these were displayed in live time as part of a five-screen immersive
                theatrical experience</p>

            <p>I developed the opera over the course of two years. Once I created a working proof-of-concept that
                brainwaves could indeed trigger visuals, sound, and speech, I collaborated with a team of seven
                individuals in New York, Hong Kong, and Russia using a combination of Skype and Team Viewer. This
                allowed different programmers to take control of the computer screen and debug recalcitrant software
                code. The score, the pre-recorded libretto, and the videos were contained inside four electronic
                databanks that corresponded to the emotions of excitement, interest, meditation, and frustration. These
                databanks would be triggered according to pre-set thresholds that were calibrated during rehearsals with
                the performer’s brainwaves.</p>
            <p>As an interactive brain opera, Noor took advantage of the recent emergence of consumer-based EEG
                brainwave headsets and various other devices capable of interacting with and augmenting new
                technologies. It was developed using an Emotiv headset, a model I selected because it allows access to
                more mental states and has greater stability than other similar consumer headset models. Different
                graphical and colored representations of the performer’s states would arise and fade out as per the
                levels of emotional intensity she was experiencing.</p>

                    trigged by the performer’s brainwaves as she gazes into the eyes of an audience member</span>
            </figure>
            <p>The story and interaction took place over approximately a twenty-minute period. Wearing a brainwave
                headset for longer than this was not feasible for a performer, due to both the pressure from the headset
                on her head and the closeness of its Bluetooth wireless signals to her brain. The experience began as
                soon as the audience walked into the darkened theatre. The spectators were given a brief introduction as
                well as instructions about what the five screens and sounds represented. I explained that they would see
                colored bubbles on one screen and that the colors reflected different emotional states, which would be
                activated at various times throughout the performance.</p>
            <p>The colors and their corresponding emotions were as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Pink</em> = interest</li>
                <li><em>Yellow</em> = excitement</li>
                <li><em>Turquoise</em> = meditation</li>
                <li><em>Red</em> = frustration</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The videos, sounds and libretto corresponding to those emotions would, at various times, be launched on
                one of the screens, with different images fading in and out, depending on the intensity of the
                performer’s emotional state. The performer was free to respond through her words and actions. The
                audience’s behavior affected the performer’s brainwaves as well, generating a continual feedback loop:
                story-performer-audience-story-performer-audience.</p>

            <p>The question of how to represent the interior workings of someone’s brain guided my work. Humans are
                hard-wired to understand stories, and I wanted drama and narration to prevail in such a highly technical
                environment. I learned through my work that audiences were drawn in by unexpected twists in conflict and
                when the boundaries between the real and the unreal unraveled — when outer perceptions and inner
                realities became temporarily suspended.</p>
            <p>The premiere of <em>Noor: A Brain Opera</em> proposed a new, content-rich environment for creative
                practitioners to explore. Although the first use of EEG sensors and the brain by artists took place in
                1965, with a concert by Alvin Lucier, <em>Music for Solo Performer</em>, and has been used by various
                artists since then, the availability of consumer-grade EEG sensors has made the brain a new instrument
                for different types of performative interactions.</p>
            <p>Is there a place in human consciousness where surveillance cannot go? These new forms are answers still
                await discove<em>ry.</em></p>
