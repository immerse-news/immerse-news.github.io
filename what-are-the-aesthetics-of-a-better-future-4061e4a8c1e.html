            <h2 id="4318"><strong>What Are the Aesthetics of a Better Future?</strong></h2>
            <p>I am sitting on a triangular bean bag in a space labelled “Futures Therapy Lab.” The walls are lined with
                books sporting titles such as <em>Robot Love, Feminist Queer Crip, The Sausage of the Future</em>, and
                of course, <em>Future Shock</em>. At tables, kids are coloring, urged by docents to rethink everyday
                objects. The exercises change periodically — a few weeks ago, they were cutting phrases and pictures out
                of pulp sci-fi books to remix them into new narratives.</p>

            <p>The lab is set at the exit of the in the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s current exhibit, <em>Designs for
                    Different Futures</em>, as a sort of decompression chamber, offering a space for “reflection,
                discussion, and art-making.” It’s a welcome intervention. This is my fourth time through the exhibit,
                and I’m still not sure what to think. Some pieces move me, some repel. Others are just…meh. My husband’s
                offhand review: “It feels like a science fair.”</p>

            <p>Don’t get me wrong: I’m totally down with these curators’ methods and goals. I get it all — the need to
                acknowledge multiple futures rather than a single totalizing one, the recontextualizing of “design” to
                include a broad array of speculative and experimental objects and processes, the allure of sci-fi and
                maker cultures, the focus on issues rather than methods, materials, or masters. There are artists we’ve
                featured in <em>Immerse</em> on the walls, and books I’ve cherished on the shelves. I am glad the show
                is here in my hometown, and will continue to drive dialogue as it travels on to the Walker Art Center
                and the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
            <p>But still — yuck. The jagged font that is the signature visual element of the show is dissonant and oddly
                retro, recalling a ’90s issue of <em>Wired</em>. A glass room featuring the simulated smells of extinct
                flowers is supposed to be poignant I think, but instead just feels mildly claustrophobic. Some of the
                objects just fall flat: The gimmicks of a science museum lose interest in the context of an art museum.
            </p>
            <p>Part of the issue here is that pieces that reflect on dystopia just often aren’t aesthetically pleasing,
                exactly by design. The counterpoint: appealing objects and narratives on such topics can also spark a
                feeling of unease.</p>

                    into the musings of a car still roaming after humans have disappeared (Photo by Jessica
                    Clark)</span></figure>
            <p>For example, I return several times to experience <em>Driver Less Vision</em>, an installation projected
                on a dome under which visitors crane their necks to watch glitchy images captured from a future in which
                lonely driverless cars wander through a postapocalyptic Seoul, South Korea. In the absence of its
                master, the car, which is narrating, muses, “It’s been a bit off since the event…you were gone and we
                continued to go.” The piece concludes with poetic lines about an Earth without humans, and it gets me
                every time.</p>
            <p><em>Driver Less Vision </em>is visually intriguing but not a slick or comfortable experience. Its dome
                looks naked, unfinished, and the combination of images from the car’s LiDAR scanner and 360 footage is
                choppy and designed to unnerve. From the exhibition catalogue: “This technique precisely emphasizes
                dissonant perceptions, illustrating how the machine’s intelligence corresponds less and less to a human
                understanding of the world.”</p>
            <p>In contrast, <em><a
                        href="https://dsrny.com/project/in-plain-sight?tags=installation%2Cvideo%2Crealized&amp;section=studio&amp;index=false">In
                        Plain Sight</a></em> is beautifully produced and hypnotic. A wall-scale video viewed in a
                darkened room, it leads viewers through a complex series of data visualizations based on satellite data,
                which capture different levels of electrical light visible from the sky at night. By comparing regions
                of dark vs. light, the piece explores global commerce, privilege, and inequity. The message is equally
                uncomfortable, but the experience is oddly compelling.</p>

                    interactions between androids, their models, and their maker (Photo by Jessica Clark)</span>
            </figure>
            <p><em>The Performers </em>by filmmaker Barbara Anastacio confronts the discomfort head-on. It depicts the
                work of professor Hiroshi Ishiguro, whose aim is to make “the world’s first fully autonomous, sentient
                android.” His creations include the eerie Erika, pictured above, as well as a replica of himself.</p>
            <p>In the gallery, this piece was juxtaposed with a large projection of a hologram of a woman from the film
                <em>Blade Runner 2049. </em>Here, this figure is used to interrogate our queasy relationship to
                simulated humans. In the film, this towering naked character’s role is less clear. Is it a critique of
                the objectification of women, the projected creation of virtual, interactive sex dolls? Or is it just
                another <a
                    href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/why-do-we-keep-putting-gigantic-naked-women-in-sci-fi.html">gratuitous
                    piece of offhand fetishization</a>?
            </p>
            <p>This brings into relief another challenge faced by artists and media-makers seeking to craft alternate
                visions of the future: They often do so in conversation with now-ubiquitous commercial narratives about
                the topic: <em>Black Mirror, The Matrix, Minority Report</em>. On the one hand, this means they can fall
                short of such high production values, looking didactic, amateurish in comparison. On the other hand,
                they end up borrowing too much from popular tropes (The future is silver! Translucent! Urban! Filled
                with black leather!) to an extent that they do not feel original. All too often, the futures on offer
                are disappointing: corporate and shiny, hard-edged and nasty, chilly and chilling.</p>

                    on the sound waves of birds in flight (Photo by Jessica Clark)</span></figure>
            <p>A few of the pieces in this show do manage to break from these confines to present something fresh. For
                example, the Synopia Finale Dress, designed by Iris van Herpen, is based on sound waves of birds in
                flight. It’s both pleasing to look at and conceptually elegant, meshing cutting-edge media and
                materials.</p>
            <p>Perhaps what I am seeking — an aesthetic not just for different futures but a better one — has not
                cohered. Previous social justice movements had the benefits of hand-crafted or DIY aesthetics to set
                them apart: Hand-lettered protest signs, the cut-up punk aesthetic, trippy hippy-dippy illustrations.
                Not always gorgeous, mind you, but distinctive. But now, independent makers are often working with the
                same tools as corporations — rendering everything similar.</p>
            <p>Perhaps what this palpably dystopian moment demands is a different conception of beauty — one that’s less
                based on pleasing surfaces or structural symmetry, more on the identities and intentions of the makers.
                Sasha Costanza-Chock documents some of these efforts to shift the frame in her new book, <em><a
                        href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-justice">Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to
                        Build the Worlds We Need</a></em><em>. </em>In January, we published a <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/seeding-a-futures-imaginarium-5114c6917226">trio of articles</a> about
                the Guild of Future Architects, founded by Sharon Chang. In an <a
                    href="https://itp.nyu.edu/adjacent/issue-6/unadulterated-wonder-imagining-the-future-of-imagination/">essay
                    for the online journal </a><em><a
                        href="https://itp.nyu.edu/adjacent/issue-6/unadulterated-wonder-imagining-the-future-of-imagination/">Adjacent</a></em>,
                Chang calls for a “more beautiful future,” which would be collectively developed, “socially democratic,
                culturally diverse and economically equitable.” Beauty here then, is contrasted with the hideousness of
                tyranny and prejudice.</p>
            <p>But in the end, perhaps what critics like me are seeking doesn’t really matter so much. There are
                numerous possible futures — and letting go of controlling or predicting “the future” can provide space
                for aesthetics yet to be realized. In the catalogue, a conversation between the exhibition curators ends
                with this thought: “[W]e are talking about futures <em>plural — </em>multiple, contingent, socially
                located, and yet to be formed. Onward.”</p>
