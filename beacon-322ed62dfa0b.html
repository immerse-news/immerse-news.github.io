            <p>Based in Johannesburg, South Africa, Eden Labs use a variety of mixed reality technology and other
                digital media to tell stories. They are true tinkerers, using whatever it takes to make ambitious and
                often jaw-dropping work. They have created a range of beautiful 3D printed headsets for VR projects,
                making sure that the tech is not front and center of the works they present (even though the tech is
                very, very impressive). The latest project, the beautifully animated <em>The Lost Botanist</em> in
                collaboration with <a href="http://www.tulipsandchimneys.tv/">Tulips and Chimneys</a>, is going to
                premiere at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival.</p>

            <p>Tender Claws are one of the most imaginative, surprising, and thoughtful creative teams making work in
                the immersive and interactive space. The group’s most recent project <em><a
                        href="https://tenderclaws.com/theunderpresents">The Under Presents</a></em> is the first project
                I saw on the new Oculus Quest headset. Tenderclaws also created Pry, an interactive novella, and a
                delightful AR project called Tendar, where you get to interact with a virtual fish.</p>
