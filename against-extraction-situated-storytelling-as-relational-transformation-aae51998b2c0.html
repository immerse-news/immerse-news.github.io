        <section>
            <p>One day, as I was filing some paperwork, I came across my medical records where it had been written:
                “Birth Control: Copper T Intrauterine Device (IUD).”</p>
            <p><em>How could I be so ignorant about this piece of technology that’s inside my very own snatch? </em>My
                self-disappointment then turned to wonder. <em>Where does the copper in my snatch come from?</em></p>
            <figure><iframe

            <p>So begins a <em><a href="http://www.snatchural.org">SNATCHural HISTORY of COPPER</a></em><em>,</em> a
                transmedia project in which I explore copper, a mineral on which our households, cities, digital
                desires, and selves depend.</p>
            <p>To learn what’s at stake, I trace a line between my snatch and your screen.</p>
            <p><strong>The Source</strong></p>
            <p>Copper is a mineral requiring an intensive extractive process that has polluted 40% of America’s
                headwaters. Copper, a mineral, dear reader, on which our on-screen intimacy in this very article
                depends.</p>
            <p>Since we started using copper back in 8700 BCE, we’ve used up all of the best and purest copper that’s
                been laying around on the crust of the earth. Today, we have to dig deeper through more and more impure
                rock (ore) to yield the same amount. It’s energy-intensive and highly toxic: while the extraction of
                gold, copper, iron, and bauxite contributes to <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/8/2881/pdf">2%
                    of all global carbon emissions</a>, the downstream <em>processing</em> of these metals contributes
                to nearly a quarter of all global carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>If you are one of the 170 million women out there with IUDs, you may be wondering if the copper in your
                cooch is contributing to climate change. Good news! Your IUD is effective, relatively low-cost, and a
                critical low-carbon tool. Just a single penny would yield enough copper to produce ten IUDs.</p>
            <p>Likely, the copper in your IUD comes from the Rio Tinto-owned Bingham Copper Mine, which produces 1% of
                the world’s copper and 70% of America’s copper. The amount of excavated rock (ore) it takes to yield the
                copper used in my IUD is a scoop of earth the size of a tablespoon. And the amount of ore it would take
                to yield the copper for us ladies who comprise the global club of copper IUD owners is about the size of
                a minivan—an efficient and <em>good </em>use of copper.</p>

                        href="https://www.21cmuseumhotels.com/museum/exhibit/gifts-of-earth-and-extimacy/">Gifts of
                        Earth and Extimacy</a>” (2020), an installation at 21c Durham by Marisa Morán Jahn and architect
                    Rafi Segal, <em>invites the viewer to examine three artifacts that extend our digital, corporeal and
                        libidinal selves: a contemporary copper-based IUD (intrauterine device), an ancient Hellenic
                        copper-based contraceptive device (“pessary”) from 400 BCE, and a motherboard used in personal
                        computers. Together, the three artifacts present a fascinating story of extimacy — the mediation
                        of intimacy through technology — and the continuum between flesh and earth. Altogether these
                        three gifts sensitize us to desire — and its regulation — as a way of knowing ourselves, each
                        other, and our environs.</em></span></figure>
            <p>What are inefficient uses of copper? The greatest source of copper consumption is urban expansion — all
                those pipes, cables, wires, and AIs running on data farms that power our so-called “smart cities.” As
                Nicole Starosielski points out, although we imagine cloud-borne satellites to connect continents, today,
                99% of all signal traffic occurs through terrestrial underwater sea cables whose inner fiber optic
                cables are insulated by surrounding copper wires. And the demand for copper is only rising: according to
                predictions, the demand for copper will <a
                    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378016300802">increase between 275%
                    and 350% by 2050</a>.</p>
            <p>So whether via snatch or screen, most of us living in the global North are implicated in the consequences
                of copper extraction.</p>
            <h3 id="ef14"><strong>Mine(s) and Others</strong></h3>
            <p>The majority of those reading this article live far removed from sites of extraction. As a consequence,
                and in spite of our digital hyper-connectivity, we remain unaware, uninformed, and unable to monitor
                those powers (corporate, governmental, paramilitary) that profit from mining.</p>
            <p>As an artist who’s spent several years teaching art, transmedia, and cultural studies at Columbia
                University, The New School, and lastly at MIT — the latter institution whose founding was based in part
                on prospecting for raw resources like copper — it seems imperative for me to recognize and question our
                role in the extractive industry.</p>

            <p>In “Mine(s) and Others,” a workshop co-taught with architect and MIT Associate Professor <a
                    href="https://rafisegal.com/">Rafi Segal</a>, we explored transmedia storytelling’s power to
                strengthen a sense of connection, strengthen accountability, and call attention to the complexity of
                extractive landscapes — our dependency and desires, the promise of sustainability, indigenous
                sovereignty, and a biopolitical revaluation of the subjugation inherent in rapacious extraction. Working
                in partnership with the Center for Biological Diversity, whose advocacy halted a copper mine from
                destroying an ecological hotspot <a
                    href="https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/judge-overturns-wildlife-agencys-approval-of-rosemont-copper-mine-in-arizona-2020-02-10/">where
                    jaguars freely roam</a>, our students sought to create short films that environmental activists and
                advocates could screen, use in community meetings, and include in social media campaigns to reach
                broader audiences.</p>
            <p>In one video, two students, Caroline Nockelby-White and Catherine Lie, a <a
                    href="https://vimeo.com/393951531">phantasmagoric cellphone</a> chides its former owner who intended
                to recycle the phone. The phone instead ends up being disassembled in a junk pile. The backstory here is
                that due to a host of factors — weak environmental regulation, supply chain opacity, outdated mining
                laws, and a capitalist free market — extraction is incentivized over recycling (despite the fact that
                copper is nearly 100% recyclable).</p>
            <h3 id="6e66"><strong>Extracting resources, extracting narratives</strong></h3>
            <p>Alongside examining these materialist mechanisms, our workshop examined the phenomenological
                pre-conditions to an extractive approach. As Macarena Gómez-Barris writes in <em><a
                        href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/Assets/PubMaterials/978-0-8223-6897-7_601.pdf">The Extractive
                        Zone</a></em><em> </em>(2017):</p>
            <p><em>Before the colonial project could prosper, it had to render territories and people extractible, and
                    it did so through a matrix of symbolic, physical, and representational violence. Therefore, the
                    extractive view sees territories as commodities, rendering land as for the taking, while also
                    devalorizing the hidden worlds that form the nexus of human and nonhuman multiplicity. This
                    viewpoint, similar to the colonial gaze, facilitates the re-organization of territories,
                    populations, and plant and animal life into extractible data and natural resources for material and
                    immaterial accumulation.</em></p>
            <p>Gómez-Barris point out that for extraction to take place, earth and bodies must be necessarily recognized
                as usable assets that could be converted to personal gain.</p>
            <p>As a storyteller, it’s hard not to draw analogies between extractive mining and extractive storytelling:
                both profit from the lived experiences and environments of historically under-served communities.</p>

                workers (specifically, <a href="http://www.careforce.co">domestic workers</a>, street vendors, migrant
                workers) precisely because these stories are systematically excluded. Without these authentic, nuanced
                voices, democracy is threatened.</p>

            <p>Situated storytelling, as opposed to extractive storytelling, relates to what <a

                describe as sensory ethnography: “a route to understanding other people’s emplacement through
                collaborative and reflexive exploration.” For me, I draw upon my experience as the daughter of Chinese
                and Ecuadorian immigrants to transform vignettes of grit and grace into larger structural patterns that
                enable us to act.</p>

            <p>Situated storytelling is also cosmological world-building. I turn to and find inspiration from <a
                    href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/Territories-of-Difference">Arturo Escobar</a>’s notion of
                <em>redes</em>: “In contrast to the English word ‘networks’, the Spanish word <em>redes </em>(nets)
                suggests a lack of strict pattern regularity. Redes are shaped by use and user and are always being
                repaired, as life and movements are ineluctably produced in and through relations in a dynamic fashion.”
                Upturning anthropocentric narratives, Escobar’s notion of <em>redes </em>refers to not only humans but
                other life forms (animals, minerals, vegetables, dirt) on which we depend.

            <p>Skulls swirling in the background, I warn against destroying our tender relationship: “You <em>depend
                </em>on me.”</p>
            <p>I turn to butter again when you confirm you see me, and see us, a continuum between flesh and earth.</p>
            <p>On the one hand, situated storytelling is a process of self-transformation in which the nuances of our
                experiences alchemically conjoin with the myths enriching our cultural imagination. I draw on Giorgio
                Agamben’s writing in <em><a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=2003">Homo Sacer</a></em> (1998)
                to inform my artwork that queries extraction, metallurgy, and transmedia storytelling: “The
                transformation of metals occurs hand in hand with the transformation of the subject…the care of the self
                necessarily passes through a work; it inextricably implies an alchemy”</p>
            <p>But here, the emphasis on the <em>individuated</em> self implied by the word “self-transformation”
                <em>denies</em> the power of stories to transform ourselves relationally, as entire communities.
                Situated storytelling, I’m suggesting, is a process of <strong>relational transformation</strong>, a
                ritual or <em><strong>communion</strong></em> whose participants together undergo a shift in being.
