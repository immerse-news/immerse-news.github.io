            <p>What do the new models of leadership look like with a mindful, intentional approach to creating new
                spaces for co-creative models? In flattening and shifting power dynamics, co-creators learn to respect
                expertise in non-hierarchical systems.</p>

                roles. In <a href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-2">Part 2 of the
                </a><em>Collective Wisdom</em><a href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-2">

                illustration of new roles gleaned from interviews and group sessions.</p>
