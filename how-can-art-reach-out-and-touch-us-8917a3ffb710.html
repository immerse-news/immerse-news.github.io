            <h3 id="b6bd">A primer on haptic tech innovation and new possibilities for access in dance — from dancer,
                choreographer and product designer Laurel Lawson</h3>
            <h3 id="004e"><strong>I. “Disability is an art.” — Neil Marcus</strong></h3>
            <p>The history of dance and disability is fraught.</p>
            <p>I refer to disability here as an identity, as personal and political practice. This is divorced from the
                medical model, which uses disability as a means-tested umbrella term for impairment, and from the social
                model, which examines the systemic and neglects the personal.</p>
            <p>There have always been disabled artists, but a climate that views disability as critical context rather
                than debilitation has been until recently almost nonexistent. In the United States, small pockets of
                artists have sprung up more or less concurrent with our disability civil rights movement, often loosely
                united by shared access needs. The trend of recognizing disability as culture and practice is relatively
                new and institutions are struggling with the related but different concepts of access, equity and
                justice.</p>
            <p>Community is one source of our strength. Often difficult, the work of uniting across varied bodyminds
                calls for a practice of de-centering: the conscious awareness that our way of being and sensing is not
                the only way, and that there is no best way. Disability is an identity which encompasses us however
                differently we exist in the world. We know that there is no such thing as normal: there is no
                justification to prioritize the way one person moves or communicates above another. Justice requires a
                shared commitment to bridging our radically different ways of being.</p>
            <p>The multiple and varied experiences of disability offer fertile ground for artistry. What can we create
                when we decenter our individual, inherently limited preferences? What might we choreograph when we value
                each new embodiment that enters the room? The experience of difference and multiplicity of
                em(mind)bodiment is largely unique to disabled people; thus we claim the artistic fruits of infinite
                variety.</p>
            <h3 id="be48"><strong>II. Reach out and touch someone</strong></h3>
            <p>Experiencing performance visually is embedded in English. We go “see a show.” We sit at a remove and
                watch performers onstage. We are comfortable in the clarity of our respective roles and social scripts.
                And yet, there is tension between the passivity of viewing and artists’ goals of communication and
                interaction. Great art should change everyone involved.</p>
            <p>Dance communicates primarily through movement: both large, like thrilling lifts or dramatic falls, and
                small, like the emotional nuance of the turn of a head or crook of a finger. Dancers train for thousands
                of hours to accurately communicate through this language of the body — and then we further augment the
                performer’s body with various technologies which create immersive and spectacular effects. Examples
                include wearable technologies such as the ballet dancer’s pointe shoe or aerialist’s unitard and
                environmental technologies such as lighting and projection, music and sound effects. Do these seem,
                well, low-tech? Behind the scenes, they are controlled by carefully programmed software cues and
                hardware ranging from a single laptop to racks of servers backstage. The hour or two we enjoy is the tip
                of an infrastructural iceberg.</p>
            <p>And still, these widely used technologies cater to only two channels of perception: vision and hearing.
                Critics of ocularcentrism remind us that vision is our perception of reflected light; it separates the
                perception of a thing from the thing itself, creating objectification. There is safety in this
                perceptual, physical and psychological distance. Dance is a kinaesthetic art, transmitted most directly
                through taking on movement. To decrease separation we should turn to another sense: touch.</p>

            <p>Touch is the most universal of our senses and the most biologically necessary: we do not thrive without
                skin contact. Many forms of perception live in our skin, with complex and individually different
                sensitivities in how and where our bodies experience touch. Kinaesthesis and proprioception are the
                truest senses of dance: the perception of our body in relation to itself and the space around us. Touch
                is devastatingly intimate, a direct form of knowing; someone close enough to touch us might be a threat
                or a lover. How can art reach out and touch us?</p>
            <h3 id="4434"><strong>III. Haptic technology</strong></h3>
            <p>You are likely familiar with haptic feedback: it’s the tiny vibrational blip with which your phone
                rewards you for interaction. It’s fast, effective and goes almost unnoticed except for the quick
                dopamine hit. But the potential of haptic experience goes far beyond this tiny affordance. Haptic is not
                quite the same thing as touch: it has specifically to do with our perception of objects. We can
                manipulate those perceptions by changing how our skin and muscles react using vibration or electricity.
                We can change the shape or texture of a physical object, create objects that don’t physically exist or
                imagine the conversion of ideas into something you can feel.</p>
            <p>Towards a practical approach, haptics could be imagined as the intersection of touch and sound: after
                all, sound is our perception of vibration in air. Just as we use technology to augment the performers’
                body, we can augment our receptive capacity. If you were seated onstage, you might feel secondary
                effects like the vibrations of the soundtrack from the speakers, from dancers landing on the floor. How
                might we imagine an experience of dance that is crafted to be felt?</p>
            <h3 id="4df8"><strong>IV. Practical Experiments</strong></h3>
            <p>This is where I began my own explorations. Having experienced various kinds of vibration-based
                therapeutics, I had direct knowledge of how precisely calibrated vibration and tiny spurts of
                electricity can trick mind and body into perceiving intangible objects or imaginary movements. I wanted
                to explore three ideas: direct interpretation of sound; translation of proprioception; and communicating
                complex and abstract ideas.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.vflvibrafusionlab.com/about.html">VibraFusionLab</a> is based in the city of
                Hamilton just 45 minutes west of Toronto. Founded by hard of hearing artist David Bobier, they are among
                the field leaders in developing new devices to record and transmit touch-based content. I met David at a
                gathering of international access tech leaders, and, through the screen, his snowy beard and twinkling
                brown eyes gave him the look of an impish, endlessly inquisitive wizard. Vibrafusion’s projects include
                devices held or worn by each audience member through human-scale constructions which can play recorded
                content or interpret bodily movement from artist-worn devices on the fly.</p>

                    type="checkbox" id="10113559481956789364"><span class="marginnote">A gesturing white man with white
                    hair in a ponytail, a white moustache and goatee and dressed in dark clothes is standing in a
                    darkened room looking slightly to his right. To the left of him in a row on the floor are four
                    aluminum pizza pans filled with water. A transducer is attached to the underside of each pan and
                    each transducer is wired to individual amps on a table to the right. Four individual sounds are
                    channelled through the amps and into the transducers causing them to vibrate independently. The
                    sound is translated through vibration as ripple patterns on the surface of the water thus presenting
                    a way of experiencing sound as a visual experience. The individual sound compositions are from water
                    recordings celebrating water as both the source and the medium of the installation. Photo

            <p>With Vibrafusion’s guidance, I assembled a simple implementation for <a
                    href="https://kineticlight.org/wired">Kinetic Light’s </a><em>Wired</em><a
                    href="https://kineticlight.org/wired"> (2022)</a>, an aerial meditation on barbed wire created and
                performed by disabled artists. Audience members hold a strand of wire which carries the show’s
                soundtrack interpreted into vibration. The music was vibration-ready: half of it created by a hard of
                hearing composer, half by a disabled composer working in layered sound and rhythm. The result was a
                striking and artistically communicative experience.</p>
            <p>Kinetic Light, an intersectional disability arts company, espouses a practice of many entry points into
                our work. Audiences could have this haptic experience in combination with watching the stage or
                listening to the multi-track audio description delivered through the <a
                    href="http://kineticlight.org/audimance">Audimance</a> app. First tested in <em>Wired’s </em>Chicago
                and New York premieres, this technology proved so popular and powerful that we quickly adopted it for
                our other shows. And yet this only begins to touch (lightly upon) the potential of this new medium.</p>
            <h3 id="1540"><strong>V. Centering disabled joy</strong></h3>
            <p>Making art that values and centers disabled knowledge and joy means centering people with direct
                experience. We can find leadership in the medium of touch in DeafBlind practice. Created by and in
                DeafBlind community, Protactile is a language of the skin: perceived through touch, pressure and
                proprioception. It is distinct from tactile ASL (American Sign Language), which attempts to use touch
                and various forms of haptic feedback to translate visually-centered ASL to a nonvisual form. Protactile
                grew out of personal and cultural imperatives for direct experience, connection and communication.</p>
            <p>Meaning never develops in a vacuum. We interpret language and art based on our cultural context, and we
                modulate our understanding according to the medium of our experience. Protactile and other
                touch-centered systems often use multiple interpreters to communicate complex meaning and rich aesthetic
                experiences. Small clusters of people form in space, self-organizing cells which blur the distinctions
                between artist, interpreter and audience. This might suggest challenges for larger audiences or smaller
                venues, and this is exactly where disability-centered technology can serve as a way to extend and
                amplify our artistic intentions. What can we reimagine when art is contextualized through touch and
                consensual, collaborative co-creation?</p>

                    Laurel Lawson suspended in the air, arms outstretched and clasping each other’s hands. Alice is a

                    costume. Laurel is a white dancer with very short cropped hair; she wears a shimmery gold costume
                    with thick black shoulder straps. The dancers are somehow upside down and horizontal at the same
                    time, their wheels shining and facing out; if they let go, they will swing like pendulums. Photo

            <p>When access is segregated from the practices of creating and experiencing art, it’s easy to fall into a
                worldview where access is finite and scarce. If we consider that all forms of experience are equally
                valid, it becomes clear that access is part of the creative process and that both artists and audiences
                are necessary collaborators in performance. Tactile and kinaesthetic techniques and technologies are an
                excitingly direct way for dance and movement artists to share work across bodies and media, whether as
                literal as a shared proprioceptive encounter, or as abstract as a concept vibrated through a novel
                artistic language which blends physical, created and extended realities.</p>
