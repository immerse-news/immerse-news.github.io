            <p>After two years on hiatus due to the pandemic,<a href="https://eyeofestival.com/"> Eyeo</a> celebrated
                its tenth festival with an in-person conference in Minneapolis, gathering creative technologists for
                presentations, workshops and meet-ups. A midwestern outpost among the handful of convenings for arts and
                technology communities in the US, Eyeo creates a large umbrella for a range of practices and interests.
                The festival’s mix of perspectives enables cross-disciplinary sparks, as well as in-depth conversations
                among specialists, ranging across virtual reality to microscopy, generative art, data visualization and
                more.</p>
            <p>Themes of care, process and relationships ran across presentations and panels, responding to both
                pandemic stresses and two years of organizing and reflection following the murder of George Floyd in May
                2020. A pre-un-conference on Code+Care invited attendees to propose self-organized sessions while the
                main conference included panels on thriving during the pandemic and fostering creative communities.
                Multiple panelists and presenters spoke to the time and trust involved in cultivating relationships with
                communities, contributors, and the natural world. On the personal and environmentally symbiotic side,
                this theme arose as “practicing slowness” and engaging in “acts of close attention.” In the workplace,
                speakers described reassessing values and creating space for needed conversations, underscoring a humane
                shift in working cultures over the past two years. On a more lighthearted side, presenters emphasized
                play and “making space for weirdness.”</p>
            <p><strong>Embodied Projects</strong></p>
            <p>For immersive storytellers, presentations featuring virtual reality and immersive installations provided
                a range of insights into cultivating atmosphere and engaging the full body.</p>

            <p>L05 (Carlos Garcia) shared the process and installation of his 2019 immersive journey<a
                    href="https://l05.is/#/atabey/"> </a><em><a href="https://l05.is/#/atabey/">Atabey</a></em>,
                additionally explored in a <a

                    study</a> related to the project. Beginning with his family’s trajectory following the devastation
                in Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria, L05 described learning about his grandparents through his parents, a
                process that deepened his relationships with dreams, memories and ancestors, while also spurring
                reflections on diasporic identity. In addition to conducting interviews and collecting family stories
                and memorabilia, L05 studied ancestral dream knowledge and kept a dream journal. Explorations of
                historic and artistic approaches to dreams led to research into cinematic methods of cultivating a dream
                atmosphere, such as focused points of visual or sonic detail, nonlinear approaches to space or time and
                exaggerated color palettes. Turning outward from the personal, L05 revealed how these aesthetic insights
                also informed his work on the virtual 2021<a href="http://l05.is/#/radiohead/"> </a><em><a

            <p>Grace Boyle, founder and director of <a href="https://www.thefeelies.io/">The Feelies</a>, explored the
                expansive scope of awareness that informs immersive experience, alluding to up to 33 senses involved in
                perception. Describing the walking route to the<a href="https://www.isejingu.or.jp/en/"> Ise Jingu</a>
                shrine in southeastern Japan, she led attendees through layers of sensations: the aroma of a cypress
                (hinoki) bridge, the microadjustments of balance and rhythmic sounds of gravel underfoot, the shift in
                air temperature and humidity as one enters a forest path and the sightlines revealed as the route winds
                its course. This multisensory journey laid the groundwork for drawing attention to the many senses that
                exist beyond the familiar five. Working in combination, the interplay of these senses creates a holistic
                impression that also unfolds over time. Sidestepping the dominance of the visual in media and
                storytelling, Boyle outlined ways that these many senses can be incorporated into crafting an immersive
                story arc.</p>
            <p>Sharing the processes behind the multisensory 360 VR documentary<a
                    href="https://www.immerseuk.org/case-study/the-feelies-alchemy-vr-and-greenpeace/"> </a><em><a

                        The Fight to Defend the Heart of the Amazon</a></em>, Boyle described the close collaboration
                with the Indigenous Munduruku community based in the Amazon’s Tapajós River basin in Brazil. In addition
                to advising on the project’s storyline, the community’s insights into the surrounding forest supported
                the design of sense stimuli, including scents developed by perfumer Nadjib Achaibou. Interviews,
                observations and scent lab analysis further contributed to the documentary’s multisensory components,
                which take audiences on an experiential arc within specially designed immersive modular pods.</p>

            <p>Ersin Han Ersin, a member of the collective<a href="https://www.marshmallowlaserfeast.com/"> Marshmallow
                    Laser Feast</a>, shifted attendees’ point of reference, asking “What is it like to be a tree?” This
                prompt to consider the world from the vantage point of another organism served as an entry point to the
                multisensory immersive experience<a
                    href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/museum/exhibitions/we-live-in-an-ocean-of-air.html"> </a><em><a
                        href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/museum/exhibitions/we-live-in-an-ocean-of-air.html">We Live
                        in an Ocean of Air</a></em>. Inspired by giant sequoia trees, some of the largest and longest
                living organisms on earth, the project revealed the trees’ symbiosis while also connecting to the bodies
                of visitors through sensors monitoring breath, heartbeat and movement. Created in collaboration with The
                Feelies, the installation’s multisensory narrative was anchored by an emotional arc woven together with
                a scentscape, soundscape and haptic storyline. Through such immersive storytelling, Ersin described the
                potential for new ways of comprehending fellow organisms and breaking habits of how we understand and
                observe other life forms. As a beginning, he directed audiences to the project<a

                        href="https://emergencemagazine.org/practice/befriending-a-tree/">Befriending A Tree</a></em> by
                Chelsea Steinauer-Scudder.</p>
            <p><strong>Listening to Nature and One Another</strong></p>
            <p><a href="http://kitundu.com/">Walter Kitundu</a> offered another change of perspective, through both a
                closing night talk and a panel with <a href="https://www.jennyodell.com/">Jenny Odell</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.jerthorp.com/">Jer Thorp</a> on the practice of bird watching. Emphasizing a
                relational ethic, panelists encouraged spending time, respecting birds as fellow beings who share this
                planet and teachers who help us learn how to pay attention. Kitundu’s project <em><a
                        href="https://kitundustudio.com/alameda-creek-watershed-center">Ruupaywa — Songs of the
                        Watershed</a></em> combines this interest with a public art process honoring place and
                community, set for installation in the near future. In addition to a sculptural eagle sheltering a
                seating area and community archive, a soundscape will be installed throughout the gardens of the Alameda
                Creek Watershed Center. This soundscape, created in collaboration with the Indigenous Muwekma Ohlone
                community, entails translating phrases from the Chochenyo language into the melodic patterns of bird
                calls, creating a form of dialogue between humans and local flocks, as well as a language repository.
                Through this example, Kitundu also made the case for allocating adequate resources for community-based
                projects, which include time to build trust, space for the work to grow, flexibility to allow projects
                to change and funding to support all who participate.</p>
            <p>Of particular relevance for documentarians, <a href="https://dorothysantos.com/">Dorothy R. Santos</a>
                noted the common privileging of American and British accents and the English language across technology
                tools. She connected this thread to the way oral histories sound and her own experiences with accents
                growing up within Filipino communities in San Francisco. Sharing a web-based game <em>The Cyborg’s
                    Prosody</em> she is creating that centers Tagalog and her mother’s vocal patterns, she encouraged
                users to not just listen, but to listen with care and intention. From this example, the presentation and
                conversation expanded to experimental methods of capturing oral histories, with Santos identifying both
                moments of silence and background noise as elements of holistic stories. The Q&amp;A ended with
                forward-looking questions surrounding the compiling and storing of endless media files: How do you
                decide what to save? What do you let go of forever?</p>
            <p>From Eyeo’s opening keynote by <a href="http://kitekitekitekite.com/">Suzanne Kite</a> exploring
                Indigenous ontologies and relationships with the nonhuman to closing talks, the conference came full
                circle, traversing throughlines of care, community, embodiment and realignment with the natural world.
                This year’s festival brought back many well-known presenters from years past, particularly from coastal
                hubs, including a notable slate of presenters originally scheduled prior to pandemic shutdowns. While
                COVID exposures necessitated some last-minute speaker changes, the conference seemed to rekindle the
                spark of previous years, albeit in a masked version.</p>
            <p>The festival was heightened by the added energy of convening afresh after pandemic isolation, as well as
                news that this will be the last Eyeo. How the organization may evolve remains in question, but this
                reconvening has launched momentum that will likely continue across a range of forms. In the meantime,
                the Eyeo<a href="https://eyeofestival.com/documentation/"> archive</a> offers a rich resource of past
                presentations, the community the festival has built is engaged and vibrant and, as one presenter noted,
                “the Discord is forever…”</p>
