            <p>Kamal Sinclair conducted more than 100 interviews for <em>Making a New Reality</em>, a series <em>Immerse
                </em>published in<em> </em>2017–2018. Now, two years later, we are thrilled to launch a new toolkit
                based on her important work.</p>
            <p>With <em>Making a New Reality: A Toolkit for Inclusive Media Futures,</em> Jessica Clark and Carrie
                McLaren have updated and supplemented Sinclair’s original research with recommendations and resources to
                help readers further diversity, equity, and inclusion in emerging media.</p>
            <p>The project is available as a <strong><a

                        download</a></strong> or a beautiful, <strong><a
                        href="https://www.blurb.com/b/10270618-making-a-new-reality">print-on-demand book</a></strong>.
                The <em><a href="http://www.makinganewreality.org">Making a New Reality </a></em><a
                    href="http://www.makinganewreality.org">website</a> also offers a few excerpts, as well as direct
                links to resources featured in the book’s solutions.</p>
            <p>As Clark writes in her foreword, quite a bit has changed in this short time: The pandemic. Protests over
                police violence. New, rising concern over social media, algorithmic oppression, and mental health. So,
                correspondingly, we made quite a few changes:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>We took the insights Kamal gleaned from her interviewees and research, and reorganized them around
                    three key targets for action: things that each of us can do to increase equity in emerging media,
                    ways that institutions can pitch in, and systemic interventions — which require collaboration across
                    institutions, sectors, and governments. For each of these sections, we did original research to add
                    resources designed to help readers get a better grasp on each recommendation, and find ways to move
                    forward.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>We also stepped back and took a deeper look at what we meant by “equity” — not just in terms of race,
                    but gender, class, religion, ability, and ideology.</p>
            </blockquote>
