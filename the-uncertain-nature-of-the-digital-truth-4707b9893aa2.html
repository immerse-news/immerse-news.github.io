            <h3 id="d562"><em>An </em><em><a href="https://immerse.news/human-assets-624f3066c2ce">Immerse
                        response</a></em></h3>
            <p>I am with <a href="https://immerse.news/human-assets-624f3066c2ce">Mark Atkin</a> on the need to warn
                about the perils that recent advances in digital human re-creation and face re-enactment have in the
                circulation of information and fake news in our digital ecosystems. I also agree on the impact that
                these technologies will have on fiction and documentary film productions.</p>
            <p>But although it is absolutely certain that these new techniques generate urgent and relevant debates, I
                think that our digital identities already are digital assets “in use.” We are photographed daily by
                hundreds of surveillance cameras, some of which even can identify us. There is information from our
                lives in hundreds of shared databases. Our digital social network profiles are hacked. Our movements are
                tracked by our GPS mobile phones, as well as our banks’ cards and building access records. We are
                unknowingly tagged in pictures taken by others. Our fingerprints—and eye prints—are part of global
                databases. Our communications are tracked in global surveillance programs, and so forth.</p>
            <p>I also think that the real threat lies in the greatest challenge of human representation: its veracity.
                The manipulation of “real” facts and representations for propaganda and deceptive purposes in the new
                media has been present since the beginnings of photography. Although photography was born in a
                scientific context as a way to represent reality—and memory—it quickly shifted into becoming a tool for
                manipulating reality, showing its ideological cultural projections. This duality between all of the new
                creativity capacities that a new medium offers and the perils it has is still present in our days. We
                can recall countless fakes from photography, cinema and also documentary, such as the horrendously
                rigged and staged 1944 documentary film from a Nazi concentration camp, <em><a
                        href="https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007463">Theresienstadt</a></em>, or
                from radio, as in Orson Welles’ 1938 <em><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(radio_drama)">The War of the
                        Worlds</a></em>.</p>
            <p>Last year, the artist Joan Fontcuberta invented the identity of Ximo Berenguer, a Spanish photographer
                who supposedly died in the seventies, and created several fake news and digital profiles of him on
                internet. Without making a minimum effort to check the veracity of his identity, the press and the art
                world celebrated the discovery of <a href="http://www.artbook.com/9788417047023.html">Ximo
                    Berenguer’s</a> photos. Ultimately, Fontcuberta, the real artist, revealed himself as the
                photographer and that all of it was a lie to demonstrate how easy is to deceive public opinion and
                media.</p>
            <p>If the old photographic medium can deceive the news, journalists, and experts, the potential of
                manipulation of the future <em>digital assets</em> is truly frightening, however many sophisticated
                controls we put in place.</p>

            <p>The deception, manipulation or fiction in the representation of reality is inherent in the conditions of
                digital creation. Works such as Keith Cottingham’s <em><a
                        href="http://www.keithcottingham.com/1992-fictitious-portraits/">Fictitious Portraits</a></em>
                project from 1992, in which the portrayed subjects were totally digitally crafted, already showed us the
                future dangers of digital re-creation. Cottingham took us to the place we must never leave: the doubt.
                Doubt helps us to assess the veracity of representations of reality. And while it is much more
                comfortable to believe than to doubt, skepticism is a confrontational effort that we need to activate
                today more than ever.</p>

            <p>The degree of human resemblance made using re-creation techniques based on machine learning make it
                possible to skip that strange feeling called the “<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a>” that puts the audience into
                an alert position. Now, the veracity of fake videos is such that our inherent critical gaze is
                deactivated. This is also happening with VR immersive documentaries that Atkin mentions, such as <em>The
                    Last Goodbye </em>or the journalistic work of Nonny de la Peña<em>.</em></p>

            <p>Immersive fake experiences could potentially have even a worse effect than fake facial re-enactment
                videos, because while our bodies and minds are telling us that we are in another place — involving a
                very high degree of cognitive demand — we turn our deliberation alerts off, short-circuiting our
                judgment about the veracity of what we’re watching. The closer we get to the total—immersive—re-creation
                of the world, the more we must verify the reality of the content presented to us. Because the more
                excitement and emotions in the immersion experience, the greater the dangers!</p>
