            <p><em>Reality is becoming a stereo-reality. Just as with sounds you can make a difference between somber
                    tones and clear tones, so there will be a concrete, actual reality and a virtual reality. From now
                    on, humankind will have to act in two worlds at once. This opens up extraordinary possibilities, but
                    at the same time we face the test of a tearing-up of being, with awkward consequences. We can
                    rejoice in these new opportunities if and only if we also are conscious of their dangers.</em> Paul
                Virilio, 1995</p>
            <p>Media Theorist Paul Virilio said these prescient words in 1995 in a reaction to the massive changes in
                telecommunication technologies with the advent of the internet, globalization and the transition to an
                “informational mode of production.” Over the years, we have only seen a deepening of these merging
                realities as we contend with social and synthetic media, cell phones, technologies such as virtual
                reality, augmented reality, game engines and advances in artificial intelligence, data capture and geo
                located technologies. This convergence went into overdrive during the pandemic lockdown, but we emerged
                with a much greater awareness of the opportunities, dangers and technological capacity to live in a
                “stereo reality.” Today, post-pandemic, Virilio’s words take on new urgency and relevance. The
                recognized term we now use for this state of being is hybrid. In 2021, several publications declared
                “hybrid” a word of the year.</p>
            <p>In this context, we began research in late 2021 on hybrid festivals and how they hold space for
                communities in “stereo reality,” to use Virilio’s term. Our research is part of the IDFA DocLab’s
                Immersive Network Research and Development Program of which MIT Open Documentary Lab is a partner. Each
                year we choose a research question based on trends in the field and test it with IDFA DocLab’s showcase.
                The festival becomes our “living lab.” This past year we wanted to explore how curators create
                meaningful connections between online and in-person festival goers, the artists and the work.</p>
            <p>The core business of a festival is not only to premiere work but to serve as a meeting ground for those
                involved in all phases of the life of a project. Media makers, funders, producers, distributors, critics
                and audiences spend a few intense days together interacting with the work and each other. Ideas are
                sparked, relationships born or deepened and collaborations emerge. The magic of a festival is as much
                the community gathering as it is the project premieres.</p>
            <p>But many argue that in-person festivals are exclusive. Geographical, financial and physical barriers keep
                people away. They leave a huge carbon footprint. During the pandemic, in-person practices and rituals
                were disrupted as festivals adapted to the lockdown and mounted virtual or hybrid programs and
                platforms. We saw opportunities to make festivals more inclusive, interactive, imaginative,
                collaborative and climate-friendly — a glimpse of what the future could hold. But also a warning. If not
                done well, festivals run the risk of creating an inferior digital experience that furthers inequality
                rather than reduces it, and, furthermore, depletes already scarce festival programming resources.
                Programming hybrid festivals require festival programmers to challenge their assumptions and practices
                and radically reimagine the festival of the future. It also requires resources.</p>
            <p>We live in a stereo reality with all its possibilities and dangers. And so we ask how can festivals
                reimagine themselves to take advantage and fit into our hybrid world?</p>
            <p>We produced a report, <em>Creating Community in Hybrid Festivals, which</em> is a preliminary look at the
                question of curating hybrid festivals through a small pool of interviews with, first, a case study based
                on 7 interviews with the IDFA DocLab curatorial team of curators, technologists, designers, artists and
                some additional affiliates. We then broaden our research and the report to include interviews with 14
                other immersive media and film curators and curatorial teams.</p>
            <p>Our intention with this report is first to understand the IDFA DocLab curatorial team’s approach and
                insights and, second, to create a snapshot of how festival curators and their teams are thinking about
                hybrid festival goers in 2022.</p>
            <p>We asked the following questions:</p>
            <p><em>How do you define hybridity in the context of a festival?</em></p>
            <p><em>How do you create meaningful connections between festival-goers in a virtual space? in a hybrid
                    space?</em></p>
            <p><em>What doesn’t work in hybrid spaces?</em></p>
            <p><em>How can we imagine connecting hybrid communities in the future?</em></p>
            <p>We found that, at this present moment, there are significant barriers to synchronous hybrid festivals
                including the time, money, experience and technology required to make it happen. Curators and their
                teams observed that fully virtual festivals work but if people are in-person at a festival they
                generally do not want to join online unless there is a specific event. Virtual audiences will go online
                to experience the work but don’t stay around to connect with each other or the in-person audiences if
                the festival is in-person. There are of course exceptions included in this report. But we also found
                that if people thought more broadly about hybridity, there are many more ways to curate hybrid
                festivals. In our interviews, people talked about different types of hybridity such as asynchronous
                online and in-person festival goers, multiple platforms, and hybrid projects or events within festivals.
                An expanded definition of a hybrid festival makes it more feasible. And finally, one of the key
                challenges people identified is how to make an enticing virtual space that gives more agency to online
                festival goers and that attracts in-person festival goers.</p>
            <p>Our interviewees had many ideas about how to curate a hybrid festival that they shared with us. What
                follows is a summary of their ideas on how to meaningfully connect hybrid festival goers.</p>
            <p>1.Take a broad view of hybridity — explore asynchronicity, event and project based hybridity</p>
            <p>2. Identify and translate values from the in-person festival to the online festival and question
                tradition</p>
            <p>3. Design across platforms — taking into account the affordances of each platform</p>
            <p>4. Ensure agency, freedom to explore and a sense of ownership of the virtual festival spaces</p>
            <p>5. Imagine and allow for what is impossible in-person to be possible online.</p>
            <p>6. Collaborate and facilitate co-creation, worldbuilding and shared experiences within festivals and
                across festivals</p>
            <p>7. Add money, time, and staff to the curations of both online and in-person experiences.</p>
            <p>More research is required as curators continue to experiment with hybrid festivals. We don’t suggest
                discarding the in-person festival, but rather we wonder how they can be expanded. How can festival
                programming teams translate the values and roles of a festival into a hybrid environment? How can
                festivals be more inclusive and climate sensitive while keeping the magic of an in-person festival? How
                can we reimagine festivals in hybrid spaces that create meaningful connections between in-person and
                virtual communities, the artists and the work — that adapt to our stereo reality?</p>
