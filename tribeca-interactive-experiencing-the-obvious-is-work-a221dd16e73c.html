            <p><a href="https://www.tribecafilm.com/festival">At Tribeca Film Festival 2018</a>, the virtual reality
                expo was divided into three parts: an arcade of varied works in varied formats; group viewings of
                synched headsets preloaded with 360 video programs; and Storyscapes, five high-end virtual reality
                installations in a competition. Some were premieres, others versions of work previously on the circuit,
                and overall it was a great snapshot of a field that’s burgeoning with experimentation.</p>
            <p>Together, they sparked a number of questions:</p>
            <p><strong>How are we so smart but so dumb? </strong>This is, apparently, a species smart enough to create
                multiple ways to create virtual reality with the latest technology but not smart enough to notice that
                things like nuclear weaponry, climate change, and racism are hazardous to our health and future as a
                species. So we’re using virtual reality to show us realities we should be noticing without it. OK.</p>
            <p><strong>Where’s the evidence? </strong>The argument for VR is that experience is memorable, creates
                empathy, makes people reflect, and leads them to act. But we’re mostly not taking any measures to find
                out if it works any better than all of the other things we’ve been using to point out the obvious to
                ourselves. At Tribeca, only the occasional project was doing any testing. Courtney Cogburn, a social
                work professor, is working on measuring the effectiveness of <em>1000 Cut Journey</em>, in which viewers
                can become a black man as a kindergartner, teen, and adult, experiencing daily racism. Maybe Navid
                Khonsari’s <em><a href="http://inkstories.com/">Hero</a></em>, an installation that combines VR with
                other sensory cues, including dust, wind, and heat to simulate a bomb attack in Syria, will do some
                testing of the proposition that it can be used to address PTSD. Participant Productions poured resources
                into <em><a href="https://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/cinema360-this-is-climate-change-2018">This Is
                        Climate Change</a></em>, Danfung Dennis and Eric Strauss’ four-part mini-series of mini-360
                films on climate-change crises, without planning any testing. But given that this new medium could
                capture data generated by individual users’ experiences, why not find out how users use it?</p>
            <p><strong>Where’s the ethics? </strong>Suppose VR is really powerful, persuasive, and empathy-conducive. In
                that case, responsibility for user experience ratchets up, doesn’t it? But ethical questions in VR are,
                if possible, even less well-formed than in documentary filmmaking, where there is still no shared
                standard akin to what exists in journalism. I don’t have any answers, but no one really even seems to be
                asking questions. For instance, <em>Hero</em> and Michael Muller’s <em><a
                        href="https://www.tribecafilm.com/immersive">Into the Now</a></em><em> </em>are two VR projects
                that put viewers in virtual harm’s way. <em>In the Now </em>is about overcoming fear of sharks by
                swimming with them; it’s a prototype for a project to address phobia and PTSD. Should they warn people
                what level of intensity is ahead? Is it enough to explain what the installation is about? Should care be
                available for someone accidentally triggered? And if this is actually a prototype for a medical
                procedure, has anyone run it past an Institutional Review Board? Human subjects fall under special
                ethical guidelines, especially in medical trials.</p>
            <p>Users do have questions. One of them asked Evette Vargas of Digital Design about the potential effects of
                adding advertiser pitches to interactive storytelling. (The men on the panel took a pass on this
                question.) Her answer was an echo of what happens whenever I ask about ethics. She said, “The creators
                take ethics seriously. It’s a tremendous responsibility. We think about how this affects the user
                experience emotionally and spiritually.” But this platitude assumes we already know what ethics
                questions to ask, and that we agree on the approaches to address them. Oh, and, by the way, as this
                Tribeca panel showed, advertisers are eager to imbed their ads in your interactive viewer, or, if you
                will, <em>viewzer</em>. (Buzzword alert.) The company Wirewax is there to help, enthusiastically.</p>
            <p><strong>Where’s the improvement? </strong>We’re not waiting for technology to improve before we move
                along to the next challenge — which might be adding more sensory touches, to increase the intensity and
                the reality. Or increasing the peripheral vision on the headset. Or making interactivity even easier
                within the scene. But we’re not waiting to get an image that doesn’t look so blurry in lower resolution,
                or to create a downward-looking experience that isn’t nauseating. If we are, it’s not showing up at the
                user level yet. But <a
                    href="https://theconversation.com/delivering-vr-in-perfect-focus-with-nanostructure-meta-lenses-89726">hope
                    springs eternal.</a></p>
            <p><strong>What’s the language? </strong>If you want to do storytelling in VR, you’re up against new
                questions about how to structure the experience. As Eric Strauss noted at Tribeca2018, the grammar and
                syntax are not stable yet. <em>This is Climate Change</em> uses straightforward narration over vivid
                emotionally complex experiences, where you can look where you like but are given hints about where to
                look. “You’re letting the viewer explore, you’re sharing the narrative,” Strauss said.</p>
            <p><strong>What is VR anyway? </strong>Is VR a storytelling medium? An experience? An art installation?
                Check out the <a href="https://medium.com/vantage/categories-of-emerging-media-9c8d3c96004a">dizzying
                    collection of categories that Kamal Sinclair has devised</a> to answer that question. What you think
                it is conditions what you do with it. Many creators at Tribeca2018 talked about conceiving the
                experience as a work of art in the installation mode. Lisa Jackson, the Canadian Native maker of the
                National Film Board project <em><a href="https://vimeo.com/263191226">Biidaaban</a></em>, has worked in
                a variety of forms. She embraced the notion of art installation to define <em>Biidaaban</em>, which
                brings viewers into a post-apocalyptic, abandoned downtown Toronto where Native dwellers experience the
                wholeness of the world with ancient texts. It’s elegant, simple, clean, and deeply moving. Remarkably,
                it’s also weirdly optimistic. “For many of you, the apocalypse is now,” Jackson said. “For Native
                people, the apocalypse has already happened. This is indigenous futurism.”</p>
            <p>Laurie Anderson and Hsin-Chien Huang’s <em><a
                        href="http://www.laurieanderson.com/?portfolio=chalkroom">Chalkroom</a></em><em> </em>is another
                enhanced installation-style experience. Users fly through a constantly shifting environment where walls
                and pillars covered with words and drawings hover in a vast universe. It’s delightful, whimsical,
                improvisational, and gives users an experience of opening up to opportunity. For some makers, VR is a
                kind of museum or virtual museum experience. Gabo Arora and Saschka Unseld’s <em><a
                        href="https://www.thedaytheworldchanged.world/">The Day the World Changed</a></em><em> </em>puts
                users in the train station that was ground zero for the Hiroshima atomic bomb; users learn personal
                histories through found objects. A coda to the experience warns about the dangers of proliferating
                nuclear weapons. For some makers, it’s a different experience of performance. Terrence Malick directed
                <em><a href="https://www.framestore.com/work/together">Together</a></em> (a collaboration with
                Facebook), featuring two miming dancers, giving users the opportunity to be onstage with them. (It made
                me nostalgic for <em><a href="http://www.pina-film.de/en/">Pina</a></em><a
                    href="http://www.pina-film.de/en/">,</a> Wim Wenders’ wonderful use of 3D to put viewers onstage in
                a performance of avant garde choreographer Pina Bauch’s work. And I only had to put on 3D glasses, not a
                lunchbox for the face.)

            <p><strong>Is the novelty value enough? </strong>Anyone who has been to the VR/Immersive/Interactive section
                of any festival knows that it’s a crapshoot whether you’ll be able to see enough to draw any
                conclusions. You wait in line for the few headsets or slots at the installation, just in time for the
                system to crash and need a reboot. By the time you’re through, you lost your position at the next spot.
                And so on. How is this scalable to a viewer experience that can make a difference? Oculus’ VR for Good
                program teams up makers with nonprofits, and is a good place to look for answers. Their work is focused
                on 360 video, which can be easily done with headsets and doesn’t need a whole installation to accompany
                it. But you’re still bound to headsets and smartphone apps. Could these stories be told in a less
                cumbersome way? Everyone I’ve talked to from the nonprofits involved says, sure we could, but — the
                novelty and promise alone make this is a powerful way to communicate, especially with donors, funders,
                and influencers who need a special something to bump it out of the ordinary. That can be important.</p>
            <p><strong>Where’s the memory? </strong>So much work at this point in VR is being done on the fly, tweaking
                programs by hand, and there are so few standards that any ability to recall even the recent past work is
                extremely difficult. Previous generations of VR go obsolete and when they do, go extinct. Digital art in
                general has a short shelf life, and museum curators have to be part-time software engineers to rejigger
                it for display. VR’s experimental era could be really hard for anyone later to experience again.
                Scholars, artists, and users all suffer when you can’t access the past of a form.</p>
            <p>As this form struggles into its tween years, all these grown-up questions get more and more real. The
                Tribeca2018 showcase demonstrated that many are willing to undertake the experimentation that make those
                questions relevant and worthwhile.</p>
