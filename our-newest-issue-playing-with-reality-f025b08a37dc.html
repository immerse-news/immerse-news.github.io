            <p>For the “Playing with Reality” issue of <em>Immerse</em>, we started by thinking about games as a vehicle
                for nonfiction methods of recording, mediating, and conveying reality. Many immersive nonfiction
                projects are built with game engines and experienced with the same gear or through the same platforms.
                The direct crossovers in software and hardware, however, are but one way of considering the importance
                of considering games in our field. In covering developments of a broad range of games, from the
                self-aware hijinks of lyric games to the utility of business-oriented strategy card decks (the latter
                from <em>Immerse </em>publisher Jessica Clark), we are thinking of gaming not only as a wrapper for
                nonfiction content. Instead, we turn the focus onto an industry with its own infrastructures of
                production and distribution, a broad set of tools which can be further developed for nonfiction
                immersive storytellers, and a unique disposition.</p>
            <p>The longest piece in this issue is a wide-ranging conversation between desktop documentary pioneer Kevin
                B. Lee and new media artist Grayson Earle. Like the other pieces in this issue, their provocations
                render clear the different interventions that users can exert on larger systems, starting with the act
                of modifying games. The writing in this issue also takes a granular approach in investigating narrative,
                spatial, and interactive design elements such as dialogue and decision trees, rendering limitations, and
                other gameplay mechanics through the online data dungeon performance “Play4UsNow,” DREAMFEEL’s
                <em>Curtain</em>, “essay games” <em>1979 Revolution: Black Friday </em>and <em>Attentat 1942, </em>and
                Bryan LeBeuf’s interactive documentary <em>Home Movie</em>.
            </p>
            <p>During our publishing period, we also launched a new section of <em>Immerse</em> called <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/tagged/icymi">ICYMI</a>: In Case You Missed It. Curated by Engagement
                Editor <a href="https://medium.com/u/eda43823a062">Ngozi Nwadiogbu</a> with great insight and humor,
                each weekly ICYMI round-up spotlights significant events and thoughtful conversations around immersive
                nonfiction on social media platforms. Meanwhile, we also playfully covered, in interview format, two
                projects that showed up at the perennial showcases of Sundance New Frontier and Tribeca Immersive, as
                well as a dispatch from Black Public Media’s new pitch forum for Black AR/VR/XR nonfiction projects.</p>
            <p>Our interest in and coverage of more game-related immersive projects only starts here, and we look
                forward to publishing more pieces to come.</p>
