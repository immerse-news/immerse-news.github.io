            <p>It’s <em>Landscape with the Fall of Icarus </em>by Pieter Breughel the Elder (or at least a copy from a
                lost original of his). As we all know, in Greek mythology, Icarus used wings made by his father Daedalus
                held together with wax to fly. However, he ignored his dad’s advice and flew too close to the sun,
                melting the wax and sending him plummeting into the ocean, where he drowned.
                W. H. Auden sums this up best in his poem, <em>Musee des Beaux Arts </em>(named after where the painting
                hangs in Brussels):</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>About suffering they were never wrong,
                    The old Masters: how well they understood
                    Its human position: how it takes place
                    While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting
                    For the miraculous birth, there always must be
                    Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating
                    On a pond at the edge of the wood:</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>They never forgot
                    That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course
                    Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot
                    Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer’s horse
                    Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>In Breughel’s Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away
                    Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may
                    Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,
                    But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone
                    As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green
                    Water, and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen
                    Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,
                    Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Despite the epic scene, we can clearly see the ploughman in the foreground’s attention is elsewhere, a
                nod to the popular (so I’m told) Flemish saying “<em>En de boer … hij ploegde voort</em>” (And the
                farmer continued to plough…), pointing out that so many of us continue the quotidian business of our
                lives, seemingly oblivious, while others continue to live in suffering.</p>
            <p>Updated to the present day, Teju Cole writes in “<a

                    in a car or in the park — you are suddenly plunged into someone else’s crisis, someone else’s
                    horror. It arrives, absurdly, in the midst of banal things. That is how, late one afternoon in
                    April, I watched Walter Scott die. The footage of his death, taken by a passer-by, had just been <a

                        online</a> on the front page of The New York Times. I watched it, sitting at my desk in
                    Brooklyn, and was stunned by it.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In this media-saturated, constantly refreshing, auto-playing infinite scroll media landscape, how can we
                recalibrate our sense of perspective and engaged relationship to the stories we are told?</p>

            <p>Today I’m going to talk about this notion of suffering, and how in recent years virtual reality has
                claimed its stake as the remedy to countering this “human position” of indifference, or at least causing
                enough of a stir to make our ploughman curious during his daily routine. It will centre around the <a

                    commissioned to research at the Tow Centre at Columbia on empathy in VR</a> but will also look at
                how we as journalists, directors, and media makers should be thinking about audiences, attention spans,
                and the effect we want to have through our stories—not to mention, as the title suggests, dismantling
                the trite notion of VR as an empathy machine.</p>
            <h2 id="63c9">Hitting Peak Empathy</h2>
            <p>Moving from the sublime to the ridiculous, as the founder of a company called <a
                    href="http://www.empatheticmedia.com">Empathetic Media</a>, I’m all too conscious of the medium
                overtaking the message when it comes to virtual reality’s role as an empathy machine. This often means
                the best of intentions, poorly executed — as you can see in this photo of <a
                    href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/22/norway-minister-ridiculed-online-after-floating-in-the-mediterra/">Norwegian

            <p>Paul Bloom’s <em>Against Empathy </em>and his rallying cry that the <strong>real</strong> empathy machine
                is actually a book for its affordances of longer, sustained engagement and character interiority and
                development rails against the notion of empathy as a disposable, transactional experience reachable
                simply through the sensory stimuli of pre-recorded footage. Likewise, many have urged the need to heed
                the exploitation of the medium as a form of “disaster porn,” where disembodied voyeurs explore scenes of
                suffering, their gazes unreflected by those on the other side of the spherical camera lens. The
                proximity of our virtual experience is no panacea to our proximity to understanding life from their
                perspective. A message best sardonically summed up by the <a

            <p>It is worth pointing out that there is a sliding scale of empathy, ranging from the rational, cognitive
                appreciation of someone’s situation through to deep, emotionally charged affect, which can actually
                trigger a self-protecting distancing mechanism when someone feels another’s pain too keenly.</p>
            <p>As storytellers, we need to find a balance that allows for the operationalization of empathy — namely,
                for the subject to be affected and take action after their experience, not to feel relief that their
                situation is different to what they have just experienced. There is such a thing as <em>too much</em>
                empathy, which often triggers the opposite of the desired effect, where extreme sensations of discomfort
                (a.k.a mortal salience) overwhelm an individual, prompting a strong feeling of aversion. Mortal salience
                is defined as “the awareness by an individual that his or her death is inevitable.” The term is
                prevalent in terror management theory, which posits that it causes existential anxiety that may be
                mitigated by an individual’s cultural worldview or sense of self-esteem.</p>

            <p>Empathy is an inherently emotional and unstable response, which is often triggered in particular
                instances. Paul Slovic, Professor of Psychology at the University of Oregon (drawn below at the <a
                    href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/">Frank conference</a>) is a leading scholar on decision theory,
                coining the terms “psychic numbing,” ”pseudo-inefficiency,” and “prominence effect”: terms describing
                our bias towards being overwhelmed by the scale of mass tragedy but empathizing greatly with
                individuals, as was the case with three-year old Alan Kurdi, whose body washed ashore on a beach in
                Turkey, prompting huge public outcry.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>We can all relate to the saying “One death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.” Due to
                    psychic numbing, our sympathy for suffering and loss declines precipitously when we are presented
                    with increasing numbers of victims. —Paul Slovic,<a href="http://www.arithmeticofcompassion.org/">

            </blockquote>
            <h2 id="15ef">Our Study</h2>
            <p>In 2016 I was a Tow Fellow at the <a href="https://towcenter.org/">Tow Center for Digital Journalism</a>
                at Columbia University. My fellowship pitch was an investigation into the metrics of the then-nascent VR
                journalism scene, trying to quantify both audience reaction and impact of this new form of storytelling.
                At that point, only the larger media organizations (such as <em>The New York Times’</em> initiative with
                Google Cardboard) had taken the plunge and invested in it.</p>
            <p>Was VR the ideal tool to counter this response to the stories of mass suffering that so frequently make
                the headlines and make readers sit up and pay attention? In order to find out, my team (comprised of
                statistician Katharina Finger and PhD student Max Foxman) and I needed to devise a system of
                measurement. Below is a glimpse of The Empathy Quotient test — a 60-item questionnaire (there is also a
                shorter, 40-item version) designed to measure empathy (or, more pointedly, the apparent lack of it) in
                adults. The test was developed by Simon Baron-Cohen at the University of Cambridge’s ARC (Autism
                Research Centre).</p>

            <p>The Interpersonal Reactivity Index — <strong>Interpersonal Reactivity Index</strong> (IRI) is a published
                measurement tool for the multi-dimensional assessment of empathy. It was developed by <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_H._Davis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Mark
                    H. Davis</a>, a professor of psychology at <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckerd_College">Eckerd College</a>.</p>
            <p>IRI is comprised of four subscales:</p>
            <p><em>1. Perspective Taking</em> — the tendency to spontaneously adopt the psychological point of view of
                others</p>
            <p><em>2. Fantasy</em> — taps respondents’ tendencies to transpose themselves imaginatively into the
                feelings and actions of fictitious characters in books, movies, and plays.</p>
            <p><em>3. Empathic Concern</em> — assesses “other-oriented” feelings of sympathy and concern for unfortunate
                others.</p>
            <p>4. <em>Personal Distress</em> — measures “self-oriented” feelings of personal anxiety and unease in tense
                interpersonal settings.</p>
            <p>We asked our participants to fill out a shortened version of the EQ test, but found no statistically
                significant correlation between those who scored highly on the test and their responses to the
                treatments. It turns out the majority of us consider ourselves to be more empathetic than what might
                actually be true!</p>
            <p>We surveyed 180 participants, sixty-nine of whom were women and 111 men, representing a gender balance of
                38.3 to 61.7 percent. The overall age range of participants had a noticeably younger bias, with the
                older generation under-represented. We recognize the bias toward a younger audience in our sample, with
                71.7 percent of the total responses coming from millennials aged 18 to 34. We felt this corresponded to
                the heightened amount of interest in emerging technology among younger populations. For further tests,
                the age groups were combined into four major groups: college-aged students, eighteen to twenty-four;
                young adults, twenty-five to thirty-four; middle-aged adults, thirty-five to forty-four; and those aged
                forty-five years and above.</p>

            <p>In devising our own metric of empathy, as you will have guessed from the quick literature survey above,
                we were very aware that empathy is a nebulous term comprised of multiple components. Therefore we
                isolated for perception, emotion, and motivation: a user’s self-reported sense of presence, their
                ability to perspective-take, and their likelihood of taking action based on their experience. Results
                were based on a self-reported seven-point <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale">Likert

            <h2 id="d577">Findings</h2>
            <p>Now that you know more about our participants, let’s skip to the findings, starting with those related to
                story.</p>
            <p>Audience <em>over-familiarity</em> with a story can negatively impact the level of immersion and
                enjoyment of a story. Immersion and presence in VR are key, but they still can’t outweigh a user’s
                disinterest in a subject. A case in point here was the poor performance of the <em>Seeking Home
                </em>treatment, which might be anecdotally attributed to the saturation of refugee-related news stories
                around the time of the survey. Its mean score in emotional impact was lower across all of the story
                formats by up to one full point on the seven-point Likert scale.</p>
            <p>One example of this correlation between the familiarity with topics and the level of empathetic response
                was applied to the climate change piece, <em>Act in Paris</em>, in which those who reported that they
                were least interested in the topic actually registered the most empathetic response. Conversely, those
                who reported a general interest in climate change did not respond empathetically to the story, which
                suggests that these stories are best directed at newcomers to particular topics, or utilized as
                introductory pieces to new stories. The same novelty factor also applied to news consumption in a
                broader sense: the lower a user’s news consumption or familiarity with the technology or story, the more
                likely they were to be positively impacted by the virtual reality format.</p>
            <p>Another contributing factor might be the fine line that filmmakers have to tread between showing scenes
                of hardship and suffering to raise awareness, and not overly upsetting their audiences in the process,
                especially when participants <em>feel </em>as though they are in the scene, thanks to VR’s affordances.
            </p>
            <p>Compared to the squalid conditions of the Calais Jungle refugee camp in <em>Seeking Home</em>,
                “enjoyable” visuals (even if they’re alluding to less enjoyable themes such as catastrophic climate
                change) are most likely to have the most impact on users.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>A statistically significant relationship was also found to exist between the participant’s level of
                    immersion and their desire to take action.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Interestingly, those with a reported immersion level of five out of seven on the Likert Scale responded
                “very strongly” in terms of their motivation to take action: higher than that saw the motivation level
                drop a full point. This supports the hypothesis that over-immersion in stories can actually hinder an
                audience’s desire to remain motivated beyond the end of the narrative.</p>
            <p>Stories with one clear protagonist as a guide were also consistently found to be more enjoyable for
                users.</p>

            <p>One clear protagonist that is consistently on screen builds narrator trust, which facilitates an
                empathetic connection and heightened engagement in the narrative, corroborating Professor Slovic’s point
                from earlier. This is clearly seen below with the two stories featuring on-screen narrators (<em>Seeking
                    Home </em>and <em>Growing Up Girl</em>) scoring highest. The discrepancy between the two might be
                due to the fact that there are multiple characters in <em>Seeking Home</em>, none of whom are on screen
                throughout, hindering a strong connection with the audience. This sense of closeness to the narrator
                also plays a significant part in participants’ reported level of immersion: <strong>those who trusted
                    the narrator moderately strongly (mean = 5.06) or very strongly (mean = 5.73) felt more
                    immersed,</strong> compared to those whose trust was registered as moderately weakly (mean = 2.5) to
                a little weakly (mean = 3.56). There is also a significant difference between participants who trust the
                moderator a little strongly (mean = 4.24) compared to very strongly, confirming once more the importance
                of the narrator.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>A trusted narrator can increase users’ sense of immersion.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Focusing more on the format, VR (immersive and non-immersive) generated a higher empathetic response than
                the photo/text treatment. In the longer term (two and five weeks after viewing initial treatments), the
                higher the empathetic response, the higher the likelihood was of respondents being able to recall the
                stories they watched. Another important distinction that was noted between the VR treatments versus the
                text control was the level of user motivation to find out more about the subject, which also highlighted
                the correlation to emotional impact. Those who received the text treatment were thirteen to eighteen
                percent less likely to find out more about the subject when compared to the immersive/non-immersive
                treatments.</p>

            <p>One shortcoming of the immersive format, however, was that despite users’ reported higher levels of
                immersion, they did also register a higher amount of discomfort, although its moderate level implies
                this was more to do with the physical sensation of using the HMD for the first time as opposed to the
                more profound feelings of mortal salience (as mentioned above).</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Users experiencing the stories in either VR format were more likely to recall the stories, be
                    motivated to find out more about the subject, and to take “political or social action” after
                    viewing.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Perhaps most surprising of the results was the negligible difference in the level of both perceived
                interactivity <em>and</em> presence between the HMD (immersive) and desktop (non-immersive) VR
                treatments. This will assuage some of the doubts many have had about the difficulty in attracting casual
                viewers to the medium, as well as complicating what many assume is the unique selling point of
                Head-Mounted Display (HMD)-based Virtual Reality.</p>
            <h2 id="388f">The Future</h2>
            <p>Story is still the most important factor for discerning an individual’s response to a treatment,
                regardless of format. VR is a powerful tool for presenting topics to an unfamiliar, casual audience, and
                giving them a brief exposure to a topic that they are then likely to be curious about afterwards.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>In that sense, VR is more of a speed-dating machine than one designed to build empathy.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>However, we must also reflect, beyond the scope of this study, just how much empathy and nuanced
                understanding of a topic <em>anyone</em> can achieve when exposed to a story for a mere five minutes
                (the standard duration of most cinematic VR experiences). Going back to our ploughman at the beginning,
                we need to build a space where audiences’ expectations of new narrative experiences are in line with
                their commitment to them: you’re unlikely to empathize with anyone (real or virtual) if your attention
                is constantly diverted, or you’re trying to interact with them in a noise-filled environment where you
                can’t hear properly. The question lies in how we can build this attentive space of reflection,
                physically and mentally, into news consumers’ regular routines.</p>
            <p>It is also critical to recognize VR’s role in a journalist’s toolkit as a device to <em>embellish
                </em>existing modes of storytelling rather than replace them wholesale. Coupled with a longer-term form
                of exposure, perhaps through an episodic narrative released over the course of several weeks that charts
                a protagonist’s journey, we could overcome some of its criticisms, such as its superficial or reductive
                nature.</p>
            <p>In subsequent research, I hope to build on the findings to incorporate more physiological data through
                biofeedback devices (measuring skin conductivity, heart rate, blood pressure), compare and contrast 360
                video with computer-generated (CG) VR, as well as look at virtually reconstructed environments as spaces
                for preventative training and not only post-traumatic therapeutic treatment.</p>
