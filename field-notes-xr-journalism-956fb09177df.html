                    How does the blurring line between the real and the virtual affect journalism?</span></figure>
            <p>Let’s coin a new phrase — <em>XR journalism — </em>because it is needed and might prove useful in the
                decade to come. It could and should have been discussed in Austin, Texas this year. Because if you want
                to get pumped up with the latest buzzwords, where do you go? There are gazillions of panels at <a
                    href="https://www.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> with all kinds of ideas about disruption, future talk, etc.
                Below, I compile some news snippets from this year’s SXSW that led me to believe that we should start
                talking more about XR journalism in 2018.</p>
            <p>And, of course, journalists interested in shaping the near-future landscape in meaningful ways should
                focus not just on the talking but on the doing, inventing, evaluating, and re-doing.</p>

            <p>The expression “XR journalism” <a
                    href="https://www.google.de/search?ei=WO2oWpXxPOiXgAb00qygDg&amp;q=site:https://www.sxsw.com+%22XR+Journalism%22&amp;oq=site:https://www.sxsw.com+%22XR+Journalism%22&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...4943.6176.0.6453.11.10.0.0.0.0.270.1004.0j6j1.7.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..7.0.0....0.cJVdYo7gzVs&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;dcr=0">cannot
                    be found</a> on the SXSW website. It is not even used much on Twitter yet, except by my colleague
                Stephan, who reserved the <a href="https://twitter.com/XRJournalism">twitter handle</a> while we were
                talking lately. So, <strong>what</strong> does the “X” in “XR journalism” stand for, and
                <strong>why</strong> do we need to talk about it?
            </p>
            <p>It’s because there’s yet another technological shift in the making. Amy Webb of the Future Today
                Institute’s presented her <a
                    href="https://medium.com/@webbmedia/235-emerging-tech-trends-for-2018-f1dfed10971f">235 Emerging
                    Tech Trends For 2018</a> at SXSW. The very first key finding goes like this:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>2018 marks the beginning of the end of traditional smartphones. During the next decade, we will start
                    to transition to the next era of computing and connected devices, which we will wear and will
                    command using our voices, gesture and touch. The transition from smartphones to smart wearables and
                    invisible interfaces — earbuds that have biometric sensors and speakers; rings and bracelets that
                    sense motion; smart glasses that record and display information — will forever change how we
                    experience the physical world. This doesn’t necessarily signal a post-screen existence. We
                    anticipate foldable and scrollable screens for portable, longer-form reading and writing.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If you start digging deeper into the world of existing AR glasses or prototypes you get the idea. They
                look “normal” like the <a
                    href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16966530/intel-vaunt-smart-glasses-announced-ar-video">Vaunt</a>,
                they make use of voice and sound like <a
                    href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/12/17106688/bose-ar-audio-augmented-reality-glasses-demo-sxsw-2018">Bose
                    AR</a> and they will make actual AR apps limited to the screen size of a smartphone way more useful.
            </p>
            <h3 id="88df">Okay, now let us talk about XR</h3>
            <p>If you read <em>Immerse</em>, you’ve heard about VR (virtual reality), AR (augmented reality), and maybe
                even MR (mixed reality). In 1994 Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino defined <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality">mixed reality</a> as “anywhere between the
                extrema of the virtuality continuum,” which extends from the completely real through to the completely
                virtual environment, with augmented reality and augmented virtuality ranging between.</p>
            <p>So why do we need another term?</p>
            <p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/s-somasegar/">Sivaramakirshnan Somasegar</a> and <a
                    href="https://techcrunch.com/author/linda-lian/">Linda Lian</a> write in TechCrunch, “To bet that
                one specific point on the continuum will ‘win’ is a rather narrow vision of what the future may look
                like. To believe in XR — <a
                    href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/02/xr-a-new-way-to-consider-the-reality-continuum/">that a
                    fundamental shift is occurring</a> in the way people view, share, create and use media data — is far
                less risky.”</p>
            <p>So:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“XR” is a far-reaching, inclusive, and flexible term.</li>
                <li>The “X” represents a variable that is not fully known or specified, suggesting an open ecosystem.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I especially like the cross-reference to James Bridle’s concept of a <a
                    href="http://jamesbridle.com/works/the-new-aesthetic">New Aesthetic</a> and to Gilles Deleuze’s
                concept of virtuality in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Reality_(XR)">XR Wikipedia
                    article</a>:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>XR can be viewed as a manifestation of “The New Aesthetic,” the term coined by James Bridle that
                    references “the increasing appearance of the visual language of digital technology and the Internet
                    in the physical world, and the blending of virtual and physical.” Closely related to Gilles
                    Deleuze’s concept of virtuality, XR positions “virtual” as not opposed to “real.” Within the
                    framework of XR, virtuality is not the opposite of reality and digital is not the opposite of
                    biological. Rather, XR envisions a more complex relationship in which virtuality actualizes real
                    effects to the extent that our perception of virtual objects becomes fully real.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>XR technologies have applications in almost every industry, including: architecture, automotive industry,
                sports training, real estate, mental health, medicine, health care, retail, space travel, design,
                engineering, interior design, television and film, media, advertising, marketing, libraries, education,
                news, music, and travel.</p>
            <h3 id="b73a"><strong>So, what about journalism then?</strong></h3>
            <p>Journalism is the production and distribution of reports on recent events. The word “journalism” applies
                to the occupation (professional or not), the methods of gathering information, and related literary
                styles. The role and status of journalism, along with that of the mass media, has undergone many changes
                over the last two decades, together with the advancement of digital technology, publication of news on
                the Internet, and the rise of social media.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/540/304/0*sjvh6TDxArfUeR8s.gif" width="540"><label

                    article when those doubtful characters brawl on your desk?</span></figure>
            <p>During the last ten years we could see and feel the development of data-driven mobile-optimized visual
                journalism. For instance check out this Medium post: “<a
                    href="https://medium.com/global-editors-network/how-the-bbc-and-guardian-tell-stories-on-mobile-db96eb10d143">How
                    the BBC and the Guardian tell stories on mobile</a>.”</p>
            <p>Going back to Amy Webb: During the next decade, <strong>we will start to transition to the next era of
                    computing</strong> and connected devices, which we will wear and will command using our voices,
                gesture, and touch.</p>
            <p>So, obviously, there is a new challenge, which some panels during this year’s SXSW were tackling. Check
                out <a href="https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/SXSW-VRJournalism">@Webjournalist’s Etherpad</a>
                listing of relevant sessions, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reality But Better: Augmenting the World with News</li>
                <li>Bringing VR/AR to People Through Immersive News</li>
                <li>Ethics in VR/AR Journalism</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let’s directly jump into a description of one of the panels: <a
                    href="https://medium.com/@steven_king/sxsw-panel-reality-but-better-augmenting-the-world-with-news-899d3cc3b8af">Reality
                    But Better: Augmenting the World with News</a>, written by multimedia journalism professor Steven
                King. Even in their “infancy augmented and mixed reality tools and techniques have the potential to
                radically reshape the news business,” he writes. “Deeply immersive stories can be made more interactive
                and compelling with AR techniques and tools. But in the near future, <strong>contextually relevant
                    news</strong> — determined by time and location — will be delivered by AR/MR on new hardware systems
                that seamlessly blend virtual and physical worlds.”</p>

            <p>The AR/MR revolution he describes — which I’d rather call “XR journalism” — will change news delivery and
                consumption. And I would further argue that it will change way more — such as the role of journalists
                and the topics covered, or should I say the <strong>services provided</strong> by future journalists in
                an ever-changing infrastructure and a changing news paradigm.</p>

                that you can do right now:</p>

                Evans not only sets things straight by arguing that the future is always boring until we get there, he
                distinguishes two different scenarios when making use of AR, MR or XR:</p>
            <p>1) Add something to the world — basically this is what current applications in the context of journalism
                do. You might want to ask yourself why you need to watch virtual Olympic events on the floor while
                sitting in a cafe.</p>

            <p><strong>Understand “The Stack” — our accidental megastructure:
                </strong>It is crucial to get a better understanding of the world that surrounds us and the technical
                implications or layers we inhabit. I recommend making yourself familiar with Benjamin Bratton’s book
                <em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/stack">The Stack</a></em><em>.</em>
            </p>
            <p>Bratton proposes that different genres of computation — smart grids, cloud platforms, mobile apps, smart
                cities, the Internet of Things, automation — can be seen not as so many species evolving on their own
                but as forming a coherent whole: an “accidental megastructure” called “The Stack” that is both a
                computational apparatus and a new governing architecture.</p>
            <p>In an account that is both theoretical and technical, drawing on political philosophy, architectural
                theory, and software studies, Bratton explores six layers of The Stack:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Earth</li>
                <li>Cloud</li>
                <li>City</li>
                <li>Address</li>
                <li>Interface</li>
                <li>User</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Stack is an interdisciplinary design brief for a new geopolitics that works with and for
                planetary-scale computation. It shows how we can better build, dwell within, communicate with, and
                govern our worlds.</p>
            <p>You can only begin to implement fruitful XR applications in the context of journalism when you understand
                the bigger picture. I recommend digging deeper into the concept of <a

                articles such as her 2016 “Media of Attraction: A Media Archeology Approach to Panoramas,
                Kinematography, Mixed Reality and Beyond,” and her 2017 “Design for Emerging Media: How MR Designers
                Think about Storytelling, Process, and Defining the Field,” both published in Springer Press
                International’s <em>Interactive Storytelling: Lecture Notes in Computer Science.</em></p>
            <h3 id="7767"><strong>TL;DR</strong></h3>
            <p>We might not use smartphones for news consumption in the near future, but glasses and wearables. There is
                already a lot of stuff happening in the fields of VR, AR and MR journalism. While we are still in the
                early days, I propose to make use of the term “XR journalism” instead of all these abbreviations. It
                better frames and channels and helps when designing experiences for emerging media to come.</p>
