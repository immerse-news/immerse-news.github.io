            <p>Over the last several years at festivals, conferences or even faculty meetings I hear a familiar refrain,
                “Who exactly is the audience for interactives?” Many film festivals are still figuring out how to
                properly program i-docs so that they don’t end up in neglected corners, as side-shows to other main
                features. Directors have been exploring a wide range of methods to get users to move beyond a cursory
                visit and dig deep into what is often a great deal of content.</p>
            <p>As a professor and documentary maker with experience in media advocacy I see media as a first step in a
                longer process of social engagement. I am as invested in the outreach stage of a project as I am in the
                production. What really matters to me is how interactives can be used and circulated to make a
                difference. What can an interactive do that another media form cannot?</p>
            <h3 id="21be">How to engage students with i-docs</h3>
            <p>As a professor of Communication Studies in Montreal, I spend a lot of time in classrooms and I use
                interactives as primary texts, so, of course, I have a bias, but I do believe that one of the crucial
                places where interactives really matter is in the classroom, and here are a few reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The luxury of time</strong><em><strong>:</strong></em><em> </em>One of the biggest
                    challenges for interactives is maintaining attention in a crowded mediasphere where viewers can
                    click away. If an interactive project has two to six hours of material and users spend an average of
                    seven-minutes on a project, that is a pretty unfulfilling viewing ratio. Since academic semesters
                    usually run from ten to thirteen weeks, classrooms can offer a more immersive experience, where
                    students can engage with a project over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Digestibility:</strong><em> </em>Educators have been showing short clips of feature-length
                    documentaries in the classroom for years. There just isn’t time to show a 90-minute piece. Most
                    interactives are already a composite of easily digestible <strong>micro-pieces, </strong>making it
                    easy to<strong> </strong>share with students.</li>
                <li><strong>Different learning styles:</strong><em> </em>By integrating maps, data-sets, video, images,
                    text and more, interactives make it easy to talk about new forms of literacy. Medical students are
                    now using videos and streaming media alongside text books to learn about open-heart surgery or other
                    complex procedures. Likewise, an interactive can be paired with a theoretical article, a podcast, a
                    collection of tweets, or any other media.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple perspectives:</strong><em> </em>A collaborative, non-linear form offers a welcome
                    alternative to the exceptionalism of the single protagonist and puts diverse perspectives into
                    conversation. The polyvocality of many interactives works well in a classroom, where students are
                    asked to consider comparative perspectives, frames of references, and situated experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>A captive audience:</strong><em> </em>Despite the fact that digital natives are the obvious
                    target audience for interactives, my experience is that very few students or teachers are
                    discovering them on their own and the classroom is an obvious place to introduce them.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>With all of these advantages, I wanted to explore how I might design an environmental interactive for the
                classroom. Many of the environmental activists I work with suggest that the most effective way to
                address thorny environmental issues is through education. I wanted to make teachers like myself the
                target audience and see how that would impact the development, the aesthetics and even my own
                perspective on advocacy, education and outreach strategies.</p>
            <p>So in 2014 I began working on <em><strong><a href="http://theshorelineproject.org/#!/home">The Shore
                            Line</a></strong></em><em><strong>,</strong></em> a storybook for a sustainable future
                designed by <a href="https://heliosdesignlabs.com/">Helios Design Lab</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="b3c9"><strong>Who to turn to for models?</strong></h3>
            <p>I started the project by researching what was already happening with interactive outreach. I first spoke
                to the directors and outreach coordinators of three high profile Canadian interactive projects: <em><a
                        href="http://athome.nfb.ca/">Here at Home</a></em>, <em><a
                        href="http://www.fortmcmoney.com/#/fortmcmoney">Fort McMoney</a></em>, and <em><a
                        href="http://highrise.nfb.ca">Highrise</a></em><a href="http://highrise.nfb.ca">.</a> These
                conversations led to some key insights that I discuss in greater depth in an article I co-authored,
                “Choreographies of Collaboration: Social Engagement in Interactive Documentaries<strong>.”</strong> But
                here are a few key points:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Long-term partners</strong> who have a mutual stake in an interactive project play a
                    critical role in ensuring its potential to make a difference. Considering how a project will be used
                    from the outset will inevitably broaden the potential reach. And impact should not be conflated with
                    exposure since getting a project to the right audience can be more effective than trying to reach
                    everyone.</li>
                <li><strong>Media partners</strong> are key in getting broad attention for a project. Media institutions
                    such as<em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Globe and Mail</em>, and <em>The Atlantic</em> have been
                    exploring partnerships with interactive directors to garner attention around contemporary issues.
                    This model can be applied to smaller media outlets as well to reach more targeted audiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Guides</strong>. It is easy to miss out on key features in a crowded mediasphere so having a
                    dedicated person to help users navigate the site and to seed debate is critical for an interactive
                    to remain relevant for more than the average seven-minute session.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Through these conversations I learned a great deal about the emergent roles of “game masters,” “super
                players,” “matchers” and more, but I still felt that the classroom as a targeted site was lost in the
                quest for mass exposure. This is not to undermine the tremendous work of projects such as <a
                    href="https://www.nfb.ca/education/campus/">Campus</a>, the National Film Board’s five-star
                educational resource, or the stellar educational guides that projects like <em>Highrise</em> have
                developed. But it just seemed to me that if teachers were somehow invited in as partners early on, there
                might be a way to build a deeper impact.</p>
            <p>Another approach was to see what practitioners from diverse disciplines were doing to make their work
                matter. Together with Steven High, an oral historian, and Edward Little, a theatre artist, I conducted
                over thirty interviews with artists and scholars who were invested in the social impact of their
                creative work. Our main take-away was that there are few shortcuts in making cross-disciplinary projects
                matter. Social impact takes time and solid partnerships are essential. The interviews we conducted are
                featured on a website, <strong><a href="http://goingpublicproject.org/">Going
                        Public</a></strong><strong>,</strong> and in our upcoming book, <em>Going Public: The Art of
                    Participatory Practice</em>.</p>
            <p>Finally, I returned to case studies of long-format environmental documentaries that were made with the
                intention of shifting public perspectives and practices. Shirley Roburn’s thoughtful essay “<a
                    href="http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/5796">Beyond Film Impact Assessment: </a><em>Being
                    Caribou</em><a href="http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/5796"> Community Screenings as
                    Activist Training Grounds</a>” carefully analyzes the long-term advocacy strategy of the film
                <em>Being Caribou</em> and deconstructs simplified notions of social engagement. Also, <a
                    href="https://solutions.thischangeseverything.org/">Beautiful Solutions</a> is an elegant internet
                resource companion to Naomi Klein’s environmental documentary <em>This Changes Everything</em> that I
                have found especially useful in the classroom.

            <h3 id="0202"><strong>Putting it all into practice</strong></h3>
            <p><em>The Shore Line</em> is about the dramatic changes playing out along our global coasts. I was drawn to
                the coast as a subject, but also as a metaphor and even a method — as a way to challenge boundaries and
                narratives in addressing climate-disasters. The surge of coastal tourism, the increased dumping of
                industrial waste, and the unsustainable growth of fossil fuels are threatening the very ecosystems that
                protect us from increasingly frequent storms and sea level rise.</p>
            <p>Rather than dwell on disaster, however, the project features 43 profiles of individuals enacting change
                along the coast. Our team consisted of international documentary directors, students, educational
                advisors, and Helios Design Lab. The project features a <a
                    href="http://theshorelineproject.org/#!/archive?People=Architect">sustainability architect</a> in
                Bangladesh who designs floating schools, a <a
                    href="http://theshorelineproject.org/#!/archive?People=Artist">sand artist</a> in New Zealand, an
                Indigenous <a href="http://theshorelineproject.org/#!/archive?People=Community%20Organizer">community
                    organizer</a> in Panama who is coordinating the migration of his village from a low-lying island to
                the mainland, a <a href="http://theshorelineproject.org/#!/archive?People=Writer">science fiction
                    writer</a> in Vancouver, and a wide range of people who are out there making a difference. Each of
                the 43 profiles is connected to a map with a sea level slider to visualize that community with up to six
                meters of sea-level rise.</p>

            <p>I teach a course in media and the environment and one of the biggest issues students express is being
                overwhelmed by the scale of environmental destruction. Glenn Albrecht, a philosopher and professor of
                sustainability at Murdoch University in Perth, has coined the term “<a
                    href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/magazine/31ecopsych-t.html">solastalgia</a>” to describe the
                profound sadness we feel knowing that the landscapes that we love are under attack.</p>
            <p>Albrecht came up with the term as the coal industry in South East Australia was turning the coastal city
                of Newcastle into the largest coal-exporting port in the world. People were writing to him in
                desperation as the landscape disappeared before them. I wanted to create a resource that featured
                achievable actions — a place where students could discuss how place, traditions, gender, race, age and
                economic circumstances inform local methods of resistance or resilience. Below are a few ways I
                approached the challenge.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify teachers to profile:</strong> With teachers as a target audience, I intentionally
                    wanted to find some exceptional teachers to profile. We developed five profiles of <a
                        href="http://theshorelineproject.org/#!/archive?People=Educator">educators</a> from India, the
                    U.S, and Canada who are helping their students feel connected to the environments around them and
                    who are helping students initiate actions and campaigns. We also feature <a
                        href="http://theshorelineproject.org/#!/archive?People=Youth%20Leader">youth educators</a> (ages
                    13 to 23) who, with the support of mentors, are holding workshops with adults, planting mangroves in
                    sinking communities, and learning about laws and treaties in order to defend their land.</li>
                <li><strong>Create integrated toolkits and resources</strong>: Teachers spend about 30-seconds reviewing
                    a new resource and so, in consultation with a seasoned educational trainer, we developed one-page
                    workshop sheets for easy use in the classroom. I asked graduate students, environmental experts and
                    experienced teachers to author one-page workshop sheets and to design questions, activities, and
                    resources that we could also feature in our online “strategy toolkits.”</li>
                <li><strong>Test the project in classrooms</strong>: An early first step was to test out the project
                    with my students. For a graduate seminar on media and the environment, I had the students watch four
                    short videos each week, paired with articles we were reading. They were asked to write weekly
                    responses on a website we developed for the class. The best part of this exercise was the ritual of
                    writing and the challenge of synthesizing dense articles with the short videos. With my
                    undergraduate production class I sent eight production teams to different shoreline sites around the
                    island of Montreal as part of a place-based observational exercise. By visiting, observing, and
                    documenting their own shoreline, the students had a more informed starting point for analyzing the
                    site and the challenges of other shoreline communities.</li>
                <li><strong>Design the project to reach across platforms and cultures</strong>: It is no secret that
                    designing a project that would work in classrooms from Bangladesh to Canada is an enormous
                    challenge. We have had to make numerous decisions in order to balance the excitement of what we
                    could do with the reality that most teachers work with technological constraints.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The project is online and we are planning an official launch at the end of October in connection with
                Sustainability Day. I am excited to send the project out into classrooms but it will take a lot of work.
                I can already see how critical is to sit down with teachers and show them all the features we have
                developed over the last year. Despite my best intentions with toolkits and resources, every teacher has
                a different screen, a different platform and a different relationship to technology. And there is a lot
                more to figure out to make this interactive matter.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Glenn Albrecht has come up with a new concept, <a
                    href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/magazine/31ecopsych-t.html">soliphilia</a>, which he
                describes as “the love of and responsibility for a place, bioregion, planet and the unity of
                interrelated interests within it.” Hopefully <em>The Shore Line</em> is one small part of a desperately
                needed effort to foster inter-connections with each other and with the ecosystems we rely on.</p>
