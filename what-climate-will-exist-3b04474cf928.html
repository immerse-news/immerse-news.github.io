            <h3 id="33e1">Generating our climate futures</h3>
            <p>How do we visually communicate climate change? How do we balance speculation and realism to think through
                events that are dispersed around the world and projected to intensify in the future? I came across the
                AI-based climate change communication project <em><a href="https://thisclimatedoesnotexist.com/">This
                        Climate Does Not Exist</a></em> a few months ago, a project that proposes one answer to these
                questions. <em>This Climate Does Not Exist</em> attempts to tackle the cognitive biases we have against
                climate change like psychological distance, or the perception that climate crisis is an abstract
                phenomena that will happen sometime in the future. By personalizing and localizing the effects of
                climate change, the project hopes to overcome this cognitive bias and get people more engaged.</p>
            <p>When you visit the website, the first thing you see are AI-generated images of the Arc de Triomphe on
                fire and the Kremlin Palace underwater. The welcoming text reads: <em>“Can you imagine these kinds of
                    disasters happening in your backyard?” </em>To use the site, you pick a location anywhere in the
                world from a Google Map embedded in the website. You are encouraged to pick a place that carries an
                emotional meaning for you. Then, you select one of three impacts you are presented with: “flood,
                wildfire, or smog.”</p>
            <p>The website finds the Google Street View image of the place you picked (if it is available). Then, using
                Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) algorithms, a machine-learning framework that can generate novel
                images through learning from existing image databases, it generates your preferred natural disaster at
                your preferred destination. For example, here is MIT’s Dome after selecting “fire”:</p>

                    width="600"><label class="margin-toggle" for="2704147639385234091">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="2704147639385234091"><span class="marginnote">Even
                    threatened with fire, the Google Street View car is still on duty.</span></figure>
            <p>And here is the same Dome, this time flooded:</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/600/599/1*ly-WrraF5HbWozl1MNfRXA.png"
                    width="600"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>The water not only washes away the Google Street View car but also the Google logo altogether; perhaps a
                more truthful representation of a climate crisis future?</p>
            <p>In reality, measuring the impact of seeing these images on comprehension and any further action is
                challenging. (<a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/">Yale’s Climate Change Communication
                    program</a> is a good resource for anyone interested in the topic.) How effective is <em>This
                    Climate Does Not Exist</em>? Does seeing a picture of a familiar sight flooded actually change
                perceptions about the urgency or reality of climate change?</p>
            <h2 id="baff">In order to communicate the climate crisis, what images do we need?</h2>
            <p>For one perspective, I talked to Toby Smith, who leads the Climate Visuals project. Climate Visuals is an
                “impact-oriented climate photography resource” that researches and curates the most effective images for
                climate change communication. They created a useful visual communication guide, “<a
                    href="https://climatevisuals.org/evidence/">7 principles for visual climate change
                    communication</a>,” and they work with organizations such as <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/18/guardian-climate-pledge-2019-images-pictures-guidelines">The
                    Guardian</a> to better communicate the climate crisis.</p>
            <p>Smith remarked that <em>This Climate Does Not Exist</em> would be meaningful to the audience only in
                relation to places they live and frequent. “Your house needs to exist in Google Street View,” Smith
                remarked, especially given that many places in the world are still not accessible, contrary to the
                seeming ubiquity of the project’s reach. They are either overlooked by Google (e.g. I couldn’t get
                images of my childhood neighborhood in Istanbul, as Google doesn’t photograph many parts of the world)
                or protected by legislative walls (e.g. Meta headquarters). In this way, the AI project echoes some of
                the problems we do know about the impact of climate change; that many places will be neglected when
                they’re flooded, and some will be protected from it.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/400/299/1*q8dN29MWBhryzEz0NwKvGA.png"
                    width="400"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>“For an image to be successful, it needs to be perceived to be authentic; to have happened; to have real
                people.” says Smith. With this guiding principle of the Climate Visuals project, AI-generated images are
                speculative disasters. According to Smith, seeing an artificially generated future undermines the
                images’ authenticity and power: they might be less emotionally engaging than the photos that show real
                floods. Trust is an important factor and lack of it might lead to climate skepticism, and the ability of
                GANs to create realistic images (sometimes referred to as “deepfakes”) and thus undermine images as a
                source of truth has already been <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/new-conversation-series-deepfakery-9474db37c2f2">the subject of much
                    trepidation and discussion.</a></p>
            <p>Yet there is one issue: how do we communicate a climate future that hasn’t happened yet? The use of GANs
                attempts to bridge this gap by generating imagery. These images are generated using already existing
                image databases. They create a future using the past data; they show what we already know. However, the
                future does not mirror the past.</p>
            <p>The worst impacts of the climate crisis exist mostly as computer simulations. This is a major issue in
                climate change communication. These projections are not images but rather numbers, and statistics, which
                can be ineffective for many people. These statistics then need to be interpreted and communicated.
                Disaster images created by AI are one way to circumvent this, however they are not able to predict the
                complexity of the future. With each passing month, an unimagined climate-future becomes real. For
                example, last month, the heat wave affecting India and Pakistan led to <a
                    href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/12/dehydrated-birds-falling-from-sky-in-india-amid-record-heatwave">eagles
                    falling from the sky due to dehydration</a>. The real world continues reinventing itself.</p>
            <p>My own most powerful experiences and engagement with climate change have not been through images, they
                have been through reading. I keep thinking about the horror of the massive heatwave in Kim Stanley
                Robinson’s <em>The Ministry of Future</em>, the pervasive anxiety in Jenny Offill’s <em>Weather</em>, or
                the worst-case realism of Roy Scranton’s <em>Learning to Die in the Anthropocene. </em>These are works
                that communicate the ambiguity of the future. Climate change is not an issue anymore, it is a paradigm
                we live in. Non-visual work might have an advantage on this front to figure out the conditions of this
                paradigm and portray an unknown future because it doesn’t collapse the process into a single moment.</p>
            <p>It doesn’t help us too much to reduce the future climate crisis to a flooded or burning city. The end
                result is not what is scary. What is scary is the in between, as we anticipate the future and move
                towards it. How do we initiate the hard conversations about mass migrations, societal organization,
                ethics and values for a tomorrow that might be worse than today? <em>This Climate Does Not Exist</em>
                personalizes a rather sterile disaster-future but doesn’t answer the question: What climate will exist?
