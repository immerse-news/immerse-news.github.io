            <p><em><a href="http://i-docs.org/">i-Docs</a></em><em> research fellow Julia Scott-Stevenson gives a
                    rundown of her visit to the Alternate Realities showcase at Sheffield Doc/Fest, with additional
                    comments from Mandy Rose and Juliet Lennox.</em></p>
            <p>I’m handed a VR headset which feels disconcertingly wet when I place it against my face. At first I think
                perhaps the attendant has been slightly overzealous with cleaning it between users, but soon enough I
                realise why it’s damp when my own tears start pooling on the foam padding beneath my eyes.</p>

            <p><em><a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6566">Vestige</a></em> is a fifteen-minute experience,
                exploring the grief of Lisa after the death of her husband, Erik. Animated fragments of memories
                surround me, and I can walk towards or away from them, triggering new ones. I shuffle tentatively, as my
                headset is tethered above me to the top of the dome I’m standing in; occasionally I brush up against the
                triangular pieces of set decoration around the edges of the dome.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/interactive/overview">Alternate Realities</a> exhibition at
                Sheffield DocFest (7–12 June) contained an impressive array of immersive work, showcasing a range of the
                tools and tech currently available. A popular theme emerges among many of the projects traversing
                emotion, grief, the mind, and relationships with our fellow humans. In <em>Vestige</em>, an actor
                playing Lisa provides a voiceover monologue as she digs through her memories of her time with Erik. As
                her voice breaks, the effect is heart-rending, yet I’m not sure what the intention is beyond this. I
                have nowhere to direct my emotions, other than to walk away considering the terrible sadness of the
                moment. Perhaps that’s enough.</p>
            <p>After a few projects in a row with similar weighty themes, I needed to talk through the experiences with
                colleagues. Following is a discussion with Mandy Rose and Juliet Lennox of the <a
                    href="https://www.dcrc.org.uk/">Digital Cultures Research Centre</a> about the various projects we
                saw.</p>
            <p><strong>Mandy</strong> — The one I liked most was <em><a
                        href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6570">Porton Down</a></em><em>,</em> because it actually
                used the VR experience to question the use or ethics of VR. It tells the true story of a man who was
                subjected to military trials involving mind-altering experiments in the 1950s. What you get in the
                experience is animations which tell that story. These are intercut with scenes when you find yourself in
                a lab, and are directed to take a series of tests of your cognitive abilities. It’s disconcerting. Once
                or twice the lab assistant tells you results that you don’t think are right, but you have no way to
                protest. At one point when you are trying to do a test the visual environment gets very distorted so
                that it’s impossible to follow instructions. When you leave you get a print-out that suggests that you
                have been assessed in ways that you weren’t aware of, too. I think that was a kind of fiction, but it
                was good. It called attention to the ways that a headset-based experience can be used to track the user.
                In other cases, though, I began to wonder why we’re seeing so many projects which visualise disturbed or
                distressed states of mind. <em><a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6568">Manic VR</a></em> did it
                well in many ways. But I wish we could get past this preoccupation with walking in the shoes of another,
                seeing through the eyes of another…</p>
            <p><strong>Julia</strong> — Yes, I did feel quite drained at the end of a long day of stories of distress,
                sadness and loss, across the 360 degree works too. <em>Vestige</em> made me really cry, and the
                animation was beautiful, but at the end, I was left wondering whether the monologue could have been
                delivered in some other way. I did enjoy <em>Manic VR</em>, particularly the elements that I assume were
                meant to represent the “up” stage of bipolar — floating through space with supernovas and manipulating
                streams of light with my hands. I also thought it was a useful trick to have the hand controllers
                vibrate when you’re supposed to reach for or touch something.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/627/321/0*tnHv3fdqC3iYkFgF" width="627"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="3845763788349993269">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="3845763788349993269"><span class="marginnote">Manic VR</span></figure>
            <p><strong>Juliet</strong> — My hands were the wrong way around in that part of <em>Manic VR</em> [Julia —
                <em>mine too!</em>], so I took the controllers off and switched them over midway through. I think it
                kind of demonstrates that none of the pieces were “quite right.” The attendants and set up are so
                important . If you’re rushed through, or it’s too noisy around you, or the headset doesn’t sit well,
                that all impacts on the experience. It seems we’re still at a stage where there’s lots more to get
                right.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Julia</strong> — My favourite was perhaps <em><a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6571">Is
                        Anna OK?</a></em> (A VR piece which tells the story of the relationship between twin sisters,
                after one of them experiences a serious brain injury. Two users experience the work at the same time,
                each one from the perspective of a different sister). I was Anna (the twin with the brain injury), and I
                really appreciated that I was encouraged to speak to the other user (who saw the story as Lauren)
                afterwards. We discussed how the experiences had differed, and learnt more about how the other sister
                saw and felt things.</p>
            <p><strong>Mandy</strong> — Yes I liked the agency in <em>Is Anna OK?</em>, being able to pick things up and
                interact. I enjoyed being able to throw objects around and have a tantrum at one point. The set design
                was also well thought out, with the real picnic bench and street lamp a neat device for staging.</p>
            <p><strong>Juliet</strong> — I think it’s interesting that so many of the VR pieces added objects that
                tethered them back to the outside world in some way. <em>Is Anna OK?</em> gave you a letter to read,
                <em>Terminal 3</em> gave you a badge to wear, <em><a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6565">Face to
                        Face</a></em> took a photograph of us while we were in the experience and gave it to us
                afterwards. Is this perhaps some indication that creators are realising we need something more than the
                virtual experience?
            </p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/625/323/0*X5sAY-YfYJznKri6" width="625"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="14387586065489290818">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="14387586065489290818"><span class="marginnote">Is Anna OK?</span></figure>
            <p>I really liked <em><a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6576">Terminal 3</a></em> (an AR work in which
                the user plays the role of a US immigration control guard and has to interrogate an AR representation of
                a real person attempting to enter the US). I liked how the character became slowly visually clearer
                through the piece, the more questions I asked.</p>
            <p><strong>Julia</strong> — I also liked <em>Terminal 3</em>, and experienced it in multiple layers. On the
                one hand, I would occasionally remember I was supposed to be a border guard and wonder if I should be
                asking tougher questions. But I was also just interested in the woman and her story. In a way, I always
                knew I was going to let her into the US at the end.</p>
            <p><strong>Mandy</strong> — I thought <em>Terminal 3</em> was pretty good too. The lighter HoloLens headset
                was such a relief after being closed in by the VR HMDs. And the ideas it explored were interesting. I
                found I was quite keen to role play being the guard (which of course made me a little uneasy — shades of
                the Milgram experiments). But I thought the directing was a little off, because the interviewee didn’t
                talk as if she was answering questions from a border guard. It seemed like she was chatting to a friend.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Julia</strong> — Yes, that did somewhat reduce the jeopardy of the experience. But it was
                impressive. I had to ask one of the volunteer attendants afterwards if anyone ever says no to allowing
                the character into the US at the end. She replied that she’d experienced the work a couple of times and
                so had tried different paths, including denying entry at the end. Ultimately, it seems to be about how
                that sits with you, the guilt of it.</p>
            <p><strong>Juliet</strong> — I think the exhibition space really benefited from the placement of <em><a
                        href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6577">Belongings</a></em> on the wall at the end (an
                interactive wall-sized projection of six refugees. Pointing a smartphone at a character triggers the
                person to rise and tell a story about a belonging of theirs that they brought with them from their home
                country, and the audio plays through the phone speakers or headphones). I thought it was a really simple
                and effective interface, and a welcome alternative to engaging through a headset.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/625/323/0*eR0X5dsYbLRJB6Oq" width="625"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="7014818824352252163">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="7014818824352252163"><span class="marginnote">Belongings</span></figure>
            <p><strong>Mandy</strong> — The problem though was with choosing someone from the line-up. It felt a bit
                like “displaced persons-on-demand,” the logic of getting to activate the characters, taking over their
                agency in a sense. But you are right that being able to use your own phone as a navigational device was
                very cool and effective. It would be interesting to see that used in other ways too.</p>
            <p><strong>Julia</strong> — I thought <em><a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6564">The Day the World
                        Changed</a></em> (a VR experience about the bombing of Hiroshima and nuclear disarmament) was
                overall a missed opportunity, and a great example of trying to do too much, both in terms of tools and
                experience. There were so many different elements that didn’t hang together very well: a lot of
                mismatched visual content, the interaction with some items that triggered audio was a bit clunky, and
                the blue dots coming out of our hands at the end were quite confusing as to what they were for and how
                much control we had over them. From an installation perspective, with four users at once our cables kept
                getting tangled and a volunteer at one point grabbed my foot to lift it over a cable. The animation of
                nuclear mushroom clouds appearing across the globe was quite effective, as was the moment of realising a
                thousand missiles were pointed at me, but in general there just wasn’t a coherent story to the piece.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Mandy</strong> — To my surprise I found some of the 360 video experiences the most effective.
                Danfung Dennis had two pieces about climate change in the programme. I saw one, <em><a
                        href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6585">Feast</a></em>, which was about the destruction of
                the rainforest to make way for cattle ranching. There was something very powerful about using the 360
                camera to document this process. In part it had to do with how they took the camera right into the
                middle of things. I also very much liked <em><a
                        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/opinion/silence-forests.html">Sanctuaries of
                        Silence</a></em>, which was another piece with a message, this time about how places untouched
                by human and machine sounds are becoming extinct. It centered on Gordon Hempton, a “sound ecologist.”
                The piece really made you listen, and gave you a very welcome experience of calm, which was rare among
                the pieces on show.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/627/324/0*_AoMuAar1TtN8IMo" width="627"><label

                    type="checkbox" id="4729910953451248216"><span class="marginnote">Life After Hate: Meeting a
                    Monster</span></figure>
            <p><strong>Some final thoughts</strong></p>
            <p>I finished the day with a visit to the Alternate Realities Portal, a dome in which six or so people could
                sit and view 360 degree video on the walls around them. Perhaps ironically, it was the piece <em><a
                        href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6583">Life After Hate: Meeting a Monster</a></em> which
                provided a note of hope on which to end my Sheffield exploration. It presents the story of Angela King
                in reenactment, with Angela herself narrating. An angry and lost young teenager, she found acceptance
                among a group of white supremacists, and began a predictable journey towards rage, violence, and
                imprisonment. The translation from a VR headset to the igloo walls was not without quirks; some
                compression of the height of the image made bodies occasionally stumpy as if in a funfair mirror, and
                the image was not always clear.</p>
            <p>However, I imagine it would be an effective story in a headset. When Angela reaches prison, she sits
                nervously among a number of black women, and is surprised when they calmly approach and engage with her.
                Her views are progressively challenged, and she emerges with a clear understanding of the error of her
                ways. She co-founds <a href="https://www.lifeafterhate.org/">Life After Hate</a>, an organisation
                dedicated to helping people leave white supremacy groups.</p>
            <p>While a work about life after white supremacy may not exactly be uplifting, the demonstration that
                something as simple as conversations and interaction between people who are different can lead to change
                is encouraging. In many ways, this story is classic documentary fare — a personal journey through
                adversity, and connections with a broader political and social story. Perhaps the traditional approach
                to narrative, combined with some of the affordances of VR, is what leads to both stronger and richer
                work. Of the pieces I saw at the Alternate Realities showcase, <em>Is Anna OK?</em> and <em>Terminal 3
                </em>came the closest to achieving this interplay.</p>
