            <h3 id="ea75"><strong>Demystifying. Exposing. Equalizing. Verifying.</strong></h3>
            <p>By Diana Schemo, Founder and Co-director</p>
            <p>When 100Reporters launched <a href="https://doubleexposurefestival.com/">Double Exposure</a> three years
                ago, it sprang from the belief that watchdog journalism, whether in print or film, could not survive
                without public awareness and support. Double Exposure is the nation’s first — and only — film festival
                and symposium dedicated solely to the intersection of investigative journalism and visual storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>The challenges to independent journalism, the kind that asks tough questions and holds government
                accountable, have only grown in recent years. The Obama Administration prosecuted more government
                whistleblowers under the Espionage Act, for example, than all previous presidents combined. The Trump
                Administration, enraged by reporting on his presidency, has vowed war on whistleblowers and leakers and
                called journalists “public enemy number one.” The threats to reporters and filmmakers have multiplied
                and spread, as tyrants the world over perceive a green light for crushing journalists who pose
                trenchant, if uncomfortable, questions.</p>
            <p>These twin trends—of the rising risk for truth seekers and the need for public awareness—stood at the
                forefront of our thinking in putting together Double Exposure’s fourth edition, which opens at the
                National Portrait Gallery October 10. The festival grows to five days and fifteen DC premieres this
                year, opening with Academy Award winning director Charles Ferguson’s <em><a
                        href="https://doubleexposurefestival.com/films/watergate/">Watergate</a></em>, and closing with
                Alexis Bloom’s <em><a
                        href="https://doubleexposurefestival.com/films/divide-and-conquer-the-story-of-roger-ailes/">Divide

            <p>This year’s slate tackles major stories from multiple angles. <em><a
                        href="https://doubleexposurefestival.com/films/ghost-fleet/">Ghost Fleet</a></em>, by directors
                Shannon Service and Jeffrey Waldron, begins with a bird’s-eye view of Bangkok and goes on to explore
                slavery on the high seas. <em>A Woman Captured</em>, by Bernadett Tuza-Ritter, also tells the story of
                modern slavery but from a deeply intimate angle. It follows Marisha, a 52-year-old woman who has been
                turned into a domestic slave in a middle-class apartment in Budapest.</p>

                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="6571482155058037712">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input

                    Fleet” dirs. Shannon Service and Jeffrey Waldron</span></figure>
            <p>Similarly, the opening night film, <em>Watergate</em>, tells the story of a White House awash in dirty
                tricks, where truth was negotiable and loyalty counted for more than the law. <em>Divide and
                    Conquer</em>, the closing night film, brings that story up to date with the tale of Roger Ailes,
                creator of Fox News, which has reshaped politics in America.</p>
            <p>This year’s <a href="https://doubleexposurefestival.com/2018-schedule/">symposium program</a> demystifies
                the process of reporting and storytelling on both sides of the reporter/source equation. Among the first
                panels built for the DX2018 symposium is “Unmediated Subjects,” whose participants are subjects of
                investigative reports; the panelists will speak about the experience of entrusting their stories to
                others and seeing the truth as they knew it, told through another’s vision.facebook</p>

            <p>We put together our o<a href="https://doubleexposurefestival.com/2018/opening-conversation-2/">pening
                    conversation</a> to look at the powerful #MeToo movement from ground zero. It brings together the
                director Nancy Schwartzman (<em>Roll Red Roll, </em>playing Thursday night, 8:30) and <em>Washington
                    Post </em>writer Elizabeth Bruening, both of whom investigated high school athletes, hard drinking,
                sexual assault, and the consequences for victims who spoke up. With the allegations surrounding Brett
                Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court, particularly focusing on his high school and college years,
                this panel will address a hot-button issue currently dividing and inflaming people across the US.</p>
            <p>For <a href="https://doubleexposurefestival.com/2018/closing-conversation/">Elegy and Evidence</a>,
                ProPublica reporter Topher Sanders speaks with Stephen Maing, director of <em>Crime + Punishment</em>,
                and Yance Ford, director of the Academy Award-nominated film <em>Strong Island</em>. Maing investigates
                illegal racial quotas in the New York Police Department, a big-picture problem told through the eyes of
                a dozen police officers who faced harrassment and punishment for blowing the whistle on a practice that
                destroyed lives. Across the bridge in Long Island, Yance Ford’s subject is also race and policing, but
                his look is intensely, gut-wrenchingly personal. Ford returns to the shooting of his big brother William
                by a white man, a murder that was never prosecuted, and for which police somehow managed “to turn my
                brother into the prime suspect in his own murder.”</p>
            <p>In line with this year’s focus on equalizing and verifying, the Tactical Tech Collective joins us from
                Berlin, running a workshop on Exposing the Invisible, which puts the skills and tools of investigative
                reporters in the hands of non-journalists. The Glass Room Experience, also from Tactical Tech, exposes
                the extent to which people are losing personal privacy through the most ordinary interactions online.
            </p>
            <p><em>Double Exposure</em> takes place in Washington, DC, October 10–14.
                Hope to see you there!</p>
