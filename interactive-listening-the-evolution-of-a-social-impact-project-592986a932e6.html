            <p><em>Testimony</em> is an interactive documentary for virtual reality that shares the stories of survivors
                of sexual assault and their journey to healing. The first iteration of the project premiered at <a
                    href="https://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/testimony-2017">Tribeca’s 2017 Virtual Arcade</a> as a <a
                    href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1454065214635967/">Gear VR experience</a>. In
                January a <a href="https://testimony.site/">participatory WebVR version</a> of the project was released
                to support the project’s growth and dissemination. In this piece, I’ll expand on the design processes
                and the evolution of the project in the past year.</p>

            <p>Tackling the subject of sexual assault in any medium is a delicate matter. I had always wanted to create
                work focused on testimonies of sexual assault survivors but never found the “right medium” to do so. A
                traditional linear documentary felt wrong, as I did not want to lock people’s experience into one fixed
                conclusion but wanted viewers to become active participants in the story making.</p>
            <p>When I first conceived of <em>Testimony</em>, my mandate was to challenge people with testimonies of
                sexual assault survivors, focusing on the aftermath of sexual assault — since that is what we typically
                don’t hear about in the media. I was interested in creating <strong>a deep listening space</strong>. VR
                proved to be the best medium for this, as it poses a commitment — putting on a headset is a commitment
                to be in a dedicated intimate space and be attentive. You are blind to the rest of the world and you
                give your full attention to the experience.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/400/1*9ZwpHBZbTl1XoS0MISD4dA.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges while developing this project was the creation of a respectful virtual
                space for the testimonies. This environment was quite complex to ideate: <strong>How does one design an
                    interactive interface, or a storytelling platform that deals with an emotionally challenging
                    subject, one that people tend to shy away from?</strong></p>
            <p>Knowing the content would be sensitive, the first guideline I set for the interactive experience was to
                give viewers the intuitive freedom to choose what they want to watch, but also have the ability to
                disengage very quickly if they feel uncomfortable. The navigation within the VR environment uses a very
                simple form of interaction using the VR gaze control. This allows the viewer to “‘lean in” in order to
                listen, but, also, the ability to disengage very quickly if they feel uncomfortable watching, by just
                looking away.</p>
            <p>This simple form of “interactive listening” empowers viewers to make their own decisions and become
                active participants with complete agency in the experience.</p>

                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>Much of <em>Testimony</em> is centered on the idea of devising a safe space both for those who are
                telling their story and those who are hearing it. By allowing sexual assault survivors to tell their
                stories in their own words, it potentially offers a space for these women and men to feel a sense of
                restorative justice—in the sense that their story has been heard and their feelings are valid. The
                accounts are straightforward and don’t go into explicit detail, focusing on the aftermath of the
                assaults, path to recovery, and dealings with the legal system.</p>
            <p>For some viewers the experience can often be quite cathartic. At Tribeca or other project demos, I often
                find myself hugging teary visitors, engaging in emotional conversations about misconceptions people have
                about sexual assault, and PTSD recovery. Unsurprisingly, these especially come from men, who do not seem
                to be aware of the harsh ramifications such events can pose on one’s life.</p>
            <h3 id="b990">Adapting to new urgency</h3>
            <p>Interestingly enough, when I first pitched the project at <a
                    href="http://kaleidoscope.fund/update/devlab-launch">Devlab</a> (circa October 2016), the discourse
                around sexual assault was only inching its way to where it is today. It was difficult to envision this
                revolution as it still unfolds.</p>
            <p>The rise of the #MeToo campaign has helped create the perfect storm of public outcry over sexual assault
                and issues around consent, and it is the main reason I created the second iteration of
                <em>Testimony</em>, a participatory WebVR platform, inviting testimonies from sexual assault survivors
                in the form of video, audio, or text to be shared publicly. My hopes are that the auto-ethnographic
                nature of the narratives gathered into this immersive platform would help facilitate much needed social
                impact.
            </p>
            <p>When it came to questions around VR and access, measuring impact and dissemination, it was obvious to me
                that <em>Testimony</em> needed to expand beyond the headset and become platform agnostic in order to
                reach wider audiences. This is why I decided to transform this unconventional documentary into an
                adapted participatory <a href="https://testimony.site/">WebVR platform</a>, which launched in January
                2018.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/430/1*iuNwT0TBxzBevEeNA21_iQ.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>The WebVR version is similar to the GearVR version in terms of layout and aesthetic, retaining the
                spatial and interactive experience. Yet, as a growing database, there are also options to filter the
                testimonies based on categories of sexual violence, as well as a dedicated “expert section” that adds
                interviews with lawyers, psychologists, and scholars.</p>
            <p>Developing the WebVR platform raised a new set of questions regarding participation, privacy, moderation,
                dissemination, and growth. It also meant I needed to consider how to shift distribution of
                <em>Testimony</em> beyond the film festival circuit and rebrand it into an educational venture, touring
                on campuses, fostering partnerships, and providing educational tool kits to expand the project as a tool
                for sexual assault prevention.
            </p>
            <p>VR proves to be the right medium to do this, offering a high level of engagement, immersion, and
                much-needed hype to deliver these bold voices and raise awareness about an epidemic that affects us all.
