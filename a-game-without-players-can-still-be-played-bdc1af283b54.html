            <h3 id="b9d4"><em>On lyric games, ownership, and what makes up a game</em></h3>
            <p><em><a href="https://riverhousegames.itch.io/we-are-but-worms-a-one-word-rpg">We Are But Worms</a></em>
                consists of a title and a single-word instruction within a pamphlet format. The sparse rules and
                undefined ending of the game itself plays with our pre-existing notions of what a game is and the
                possibilities of what a game could be. By defining an entire game around five words (counting the title,
                which provides context), creator Taylor LaBresh is expressing a meta-narrative about games and how we
                bring our experiences, assumptions, and desires to the table. When we as players are faced with a single
                word that comprises a game, we question how to play at a very basic level. Do we follow instructions? Do
                we laugh and put the game down? Do we sit and think about whether or not <em>We Are But Worms </em>is a
                game at all? From the perspective of a lyric game, all these interactions are valid and are part of
                playing the game itself.</p>

            <p>Lyric games take traditional formats of role-playing games (RPGs) and expand on what it means to be a
                player. A tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) is a game played by moving through a narrative space while
                embodying a different role according to the rules and structures of the game’s design. Popular TTRPGs
                include Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and Vampire the Masquerade.</p>
            <p>Lyric games — sometimes called song games, <a href="https://majcher.itch.io/24-game-poems">game
                    poems</a>, or simply experimental games — a new kind of narrative tabletop game, have surged in
                popularity over the past two years. The term was coined by <a
                    href="https://john-r-harness.itch.io/">John R. Harness</a> in<a
                    href="https://twitter.com/cartweel/status/1184514002531028993?s=20"> late 2019</a>, but some games
                have been back-categorized as lyric; this term was created to describe a larger, contemporary movement.
                Most people who are interested in these kinds of TTRPGs are both producers and consumers, creating an
                insular but thriving group of creatives. Lyric games challenge the norms of a traditional tabletop
                role-playing game by going without the typical markers of a TTRPG. Usually, lyric games employ few
                rules, minimal dice rolls or statistics, and provide little to no distance between the player and the
                character within the game. But all those are guidelines — and guidelines, in this genre, are arbitrary.
            </p>
            <p>Lyric games themselves push against the criteria of what constitutes a tabletop role-playing game, both
                in structure and distribution. More than any metric, the main factor that determines whether or not any
                game is “lyric” is whether or not the player feels like it is. While a lot of lyric games can be summed
                up as writing prompts or journal exercises (one of my games, <em><a
                        href="https://lhcodega.itch.io/the-bookshelf">The</a></em> <em><a
                        href="https://lhcodega.itch.io/the-bookshelf">Bookshelf</a></em>, falls into this category),
                many play with basic concepts of gaming and digital ownership.</p>
            <h2 id="430e"><strong>Gaming with Me, Myself, and I</strong></h2>
            <p>In most TTRPGs you create a persona that moves within the game, allowing for a divide between
                in-character and out-of-character actions. You — as an actor — are fundamentally different from your
                character and what they do. You can make a choice to either improvise or script out your character,
                giving them personalized characteristics that could vastly differ from your own character and
                mannerisms.</p>
            <p>In lyric games, however, that distance between in-character and out-of-character either does not exist or
                is very thin. Lyric games often ask you to explore yourself more so than explore a predetermined
                narrative or structure.</p>
            <p><em><a href="https://adira.itch.io/bad-moon">Bad Moon</a></em> by Adira Slattery is a perfect example.
                The game is for two players, one of which is the moon. As the non-moon, you are instructed to be pissed
                off at the moon. The game is a meditation on how there is a problem in your life that is the Moon’s
                fault, and you both love the Moon and you hate her for what she’s done to you. <em>Bad Moon</em>
                combines the ritual meditation and surreal exploration of emotions that embody lyric games, centering
                your experiences as a person, not as a persona.</p>
            <p>Lyric games often explore a connection between you and an undefinable force in your life. Sometimes lyric
                games use metaphor to allow players to imitate distance between personal emotional investments and a
                game, but many designers recognize that ‘bleed’ — the emotional spillover between a person and a
                character — can occur even when players are protected by metaphor.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/1200/1*1KAltCRL07LGQtSptyn4Hg.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="17653548396988215899">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input

                    of The Hot Spell.</span></figure>
            <p>It is this use of metaphor that allows lyric games to exist. It would be difficult to play a game like
                <em>Bad Moon</em> and not insert yourself into its rules. Other lyric games like<em> </em><em><a
                        href="https://paulczege.itch.io/the-hot-spell">The Hot Spell </a></em>by Paul Czege and <em><a
                        href="https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/the-mermaid-spell">The Mermaid Spell</a></em> by Jamila R.
                Nedjadi are about ritual. They both create a way for you, as a person, to inhabit a space within the
                instructions and allow for your own experiences to fill in the gaps.<em> The Hot Spell</em> is about
                intimacy and witchcraft, but it is specifically about creating a scenario where you feel hot, turned on,
                or intimate with another person. By allowing space for bleed within the narrative framework of the game,
                <em>The Hot Spell</em> can only be played when the player destroys the barrier between person and
                persona. Likewise,<em> The Mermaid Spell</em> is a guided meditation on pain, heartbreak, and grief that
                requires deep introspection. Both Czege and Nedjadi write warnings into their games that they have the
                potential to harm the player because of the possibility for bleed, firmly rooting both of these lyric
                games in personal experience. By doing so, games like <em>Bad Moon, The Hot Spell,</em> and <em>The
                    Mermaid Spell </em>become nonfiction pieces that encourage people to insert their own experiences
                into their framework. A game created around metaphor is still an immediate experience and works to
                reflect the life of the player at the table, denying that player distance between who they are and how
                they interact with the game.

            <p>Lyric games are not for playing but, rather, for recontextualizing common experiences in order to
                challenge the game-playing process. <em><a href="https://possumcreekgames.itch.io/tantrum">A Game About
                        Throwing Tantrums</a></em><em> </em>(published by Possum Creek Games but written by an anonymous
                author, identified as “an ex-problem child”) allows the player to go through the experience of throwing
                a tantrum by laying out rules and distinct steps for employing reactions. The player starts by picking
                someone to disagree with and uses dice to find the source of their disagreement. Examples of these
                combinations include: “You are speaking to a parent,” and “you fail a task,” and “you are speaking to a
                girl who is friends with other girls,” and “you are accused of something.”</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/1236/1*bytu_iKxG1gZjkGg3R22Ww.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="7915512050505148461">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="7915512050505148461"><span class="marginnote">The
                    second-to-last page of Tantrums.</span></figure>
            <p><em>Tantrums </em>takes you through different scenarios and asks you to roll to choose your reaction. If
                you are accused of something, you roll to find out if you argue, attempt to dominate, or self-victimize,
                but within those actions you are allowed to choose the exact nature of that reaction. For example, you
                can self-victimize by crying, hunching your shoulders, saying “please,” and gaining the sympathy of
                onlookers. By breaking down some of the ways we react to situations, <em>Tantrums</em> shows how the
                literal act of throwing a temper tantrum is both involuntary (rolling a dice) and calculated (picking a
                secondary reaction). <em>Tantrums</em> takes a familiar experience and forces the player to reinhabit
                that experience from a different perspective, creating a game that allows for a re-imagining of personal
                experiences. This game in particular is cyclical, and, much like the stages of a temper tantrum repeat
                themselves, this game makes you repeat actions, sit with your feelings, and return tomorrow to inhabit
                the experience again, structurally enforcing the idea of lyric games acting as a method of re-evaluating
                your experiences.</p>
            <p>Another lyric game that asks players to recontextualize experiences is Legendary Vermin’s <em><a
                        href="https://legendary-vermin.itch.io/until-next-time">Until Next Time</a></em>, a game about
                smoking, for smokers. The game asks you to gather a group of smokers and take out a full pack of
                cigarettes. As you smoke the pack, you answer questions such as, “Who was the coolest person you smoked
                with,” “Tell us about a time where smoking made you feel accepted,” and “What’s the weirdest idea you’ve
                ever had while smoking?” When you reach the last cigarette in the pack, each player has to answer the
                question, “When was the last time you tried to quit smoking?” After that cig is done, you exchange
                contact information. The final instruction is that the next time any of the players lights up, they have
                to contact the entire group with the phrase “We lost.”</p>
            <p>A game like <em>Until Next Time</em> does not necessarily end when you step away from the game because
                the rules say that losing the game is predicated on the actions — or inactions — of the players in their
                lives outside of the game. The rules never define a win condition. You either smoke your last cigarette
                while playing the game, or you lose the game. By re-imaging the experience of smoking as a game,
                <em>Until Next Time</em> inhabits an action within your life, creating a new experience of play and
                adding new conditions to the act of smoking that you take into your life even after the game, regardless
                of whether or not you follow those directions.
            </p>
            <p>Other examples of lyric games that ask players to inhabit their own experiences through a different lens
                include Adam Vass’ <em><a href="https://worldchampgameco.itch.io/diagnostics">Diagnostics</a></em><em>,
                </em>Natalie Libre’s <em><a href="https://bigstuffedcat.itch.io/mathematics">Instructions for Solving
                        Mathematical Problems</a></em><em>, </em>Jay Dragon’s <em><a
                        href="https://possumcreekgames.itch.io/almost">Almost</a></em>, and <em><a
                        href="https://adira.itch.io/making-love">Making Love</a></em>, by Adira Slattery.</p>
            <h2 id="b393"><strong>Reading between the lines</strong></h2>
            <p>Most of the people who enjoy lyric games also create lyric games, so there tends to be a lot of
                self-referential playfulness. Maria Mison’s <em><a
                        href="https://mariabumby.itch.io/i-eat-mantras-for-breakfast">I EAT MANTRAS FOR
                        BREAKFAST</a></em> uses formatting, layout, and other commonly understood conventions with
                aesthetic, gamified flair. Using all-capitals throughout the layout, IAMFB imitates a voice yelling.
                It’s never said in the text that this game is shouting at you, but it is. This game specifically uses
                textural media rules already in your head to create a piece of gameplay. This is much like <em>We Are
                    But Worms</em>, which encourages a personal interpretation of the text because of the way the text
                exists on the page.</p>
            <p>Lyric games delight in providing a guided experience through these liminal moments, where players are
                both active participants in the game and left wondering whether or not they’re playing the game
                correctly. A game like <em><a href="https://kumada1.itch.io/game-lamprey">Game Lamprey</a></em>, by
                Richard Kelly, has a set of rules deliberately designed to provoke. You play <em>Game Lamprey</em> by
                playing a different game and then “attaching” the rules within <em>Game Lamprey</em> to that second game
                in the midst of gameplay. One of the rules of <em>Game Lamprey</em> is that you can choose to
                automatically succeed within the second game, but you have to rip out a page from that game’s rulebook —
                an action that weakens the game you are attempting to play, and goes very deliberately against the
                commonly accepted behaviors associated with owning a game. <em>Lamprey</em> asks that you break other
                rules in order to play it.</p>
            <p>When we look at games like this, which reflect on the nature of what a game is, and whether or not it’s
                even possible to play these games, we realize that lyric games are experiments in pushing the boundaries
                of guided, immersive experiences. Lyric games take rules that we accept within our day-to-day lives and
                comment on them within the framework that players have opted into and have the power to accept or deny.
                Lyric games only really become a game when we interact with them. Until the player picks up a game, it
                is merely a scaffolding around the unknowable marble of player experience. We have to sculpt the statue.
            </p>
            <p>Lyric games take advantage of this liminality of incompleteness. If even reading a game becomes the act
                of interaction with the game and its rules, the lines in between audience and author, owner and
                recipient, begin to blur. Do you play your game as you write it? Do you experience the act of creation,
                or do you just keep tweaking your game until something comes out that’s as close to complete as any game
                can be without a player at the table?</p>

                    When you read the third slide, there is a moment of confusion where you read, “This moment is
                    inevitable I am inevitable” and the text is a self-fulfilling prophecy of engagement.</span>

            <p>Finally, one of the structural markers of a lyric game is less about the game itself and more about how
                that game is distributed and thought about by the people who download and play these games. Indie game
                creators have developed a highly accessible model of distribution that supports the ethos of unownable
                games. Often lyric games are short, require a low bar of entry to play and understand, and are free or
                inexpensive.</p>
            <p><em>Indie</em>, in the game world, means that the creator of the game is the one putting the game up for
                sale and receiving a majority of the profit. The indie community primarily distributes their games using
                the open marketplace <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a>, a site primarily geared towards small video
                game studios.</p>
            <p>The indie game community uses itch.io as the marketplace for distribution for a variety of reasons, but
                most notably is, in my opinion, the ability to accommodate “community copies” — free copies of games,
                usually reserved for marginalized groups or those for whom price is a burden. Community copies are a
                construct of the indie game scene on the itch.io system and are not an intended feature of the
                marketplace. The ability to allow creators to list a limited number of free items alongside purchasable
                items was originally meant for “demo” versions of video games, not necessarily free games. After a few
                key players in the indie game scene began instituting this social contract based on an honor system, the
                community as a whole made the shift towards providing free copies. Now, most games (with only some
                exceptions, typically larger games or games with multiple contributors) have community copies available,
                either at an unlimited amount of “paid” for via each at-price purchase of the game.</p>
            <p>There are other ways that creators play with the idea of purchasing a game. There are games that are
                available for a price but discounted 100%, resulting in a no-cost game. (<em><a
                        href="https://riverhousegames.itch.io/we-are-but-worms-a-one-word-rpg">We Are But
                        Worms</a></em><em>,</em> at the time of this article, appears this way.) There are games where
                the suggested price is a pun, such as in<a href="https://bigstuffedcat.itch.io/mathematics">
                </a><em>Instructions for Solving Mathematical Problem</em><a
                    href="https://bigstuffedcat.itch.io/mathematics">s</a>, and the game is explicitly free, despite the
                price of $61.74 showing up when you go to download the game.</p>

                    crossed out. Next to it is a note that this game is “On Sale! 100% off.” The landing page for
                    <em><strong>Instructions for Solving Mathematical Problems</strong></em><em> </em>reminds the
                    audience that the suggested game price is “a math joke,” and all purchases will be refunded.</span>

            <p>These distribution mechanisms are just one way that the concept of lyric games opposes the notion of
                capital ownership. Many creators of lyric games would love to see their hobby turn into a full-time job,
                but they want to be valued and paid for their artistry, not the object they produce. But more
                fundamentally, because of the nature of playing a lyric game, you cannot own a lyric game. You may read
                them, experience them, and then move on. You might print the instructions to carry with you. But do you
                own that game? No. You merely carry it with you for a few moments or even a few hours, and then it
                passes from you. It is an experience, not a thing you own.</p>
            <p>Lyric games challenge what it means to create, own, and share art in a world that is slowly becoming more
                obsessed with ownership in digital spaces. By creating a holistic experience outside of the rules of
                traditional RPGs, from purchase to play, lyric games are blurring the lines between audience and author.
