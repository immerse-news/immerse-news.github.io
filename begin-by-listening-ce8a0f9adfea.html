            <p>Making a new reality can only begin after addressing the existing reality, as evidenced by Kamal
                Sinclair’s <a href="https://makinganewreality.org/">extensive research</a>. In her project, she
                presented several issues worth addressing. What we lay out below is an attempt to begin a dialogue in
                response to her question “What might it look like to adjust the design of our media and tech spaces so
                they center the needs of those historically marginalized in those spaces?”</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.alliedmedia.org/dna">Detroit Narrative Agency </a>(DNA) is a project that directly
                confronts present conditions to develop more equitable pathways into emerging media for people and
                communities who have historically been excluded and/or tokenized within mainstream media making. DNA’s
                work centers Black and people of color (POC) media makers working to shift narratives about Detroit and
                build power, with an emphasis on developing tools for equitable community partnerships. In order to talk
                about our work, we must begin with a critical frame: Our strategies come out of an immense historical
                legacy of activism and cultural production in Detroit. This includes two decades of media-based
                organizing and over a decade of community-building and network cultivation through <a
                    href="https://www.alliedmedia.org/">Allied Media Projects</a>. This context is important; these
                strategies and tools were developed out of a long-term commitment to radical organizing <em>in
                    Detroit.</em></p>
            <p>An essential piece of our work that comes directly from Allied Media’s network principles is the idea
                that <a href="https://www.alliedmedia.org/about/network-principles">“we begin by listening.”</a> This is
                a crucial first step towards equity: deep, active listening to those most impacted by the conditions
                that many of us are critically resisting.</p>
            <p>For DNA, this principle in practice meant convening an advisory team who conducted an audit of existing
                moving-image media about Detroit. They were able to identify inequitable patterns, such as confirming
                our hunch that the majority of films made about Detroit are not by people from Detroit. The late Detroit
                water warrior Charity Hicks often said, <strong>“I</strong>f you’re not at the table you’re on the
                menu.” Black and POC Detroiters have not been at the table when it comes to narratives around our city’s
                “rebirth.”</p>
            <p>The advisory team then conducted a community research process to understand which stories Detroiters are
                sick of hearing, and, alternately, which stories need to be uplifted. The team also brainstormed about
                the infrastructural needs required to shift those narratives. This process involved more than 200
                community members and informed the priorities of the project and helped form the guidelines for a Seed
                Grant application — which resulted in our first DNA cohort. Ten applicants were selected from nearly 150
                to receive a year of funding, training, mentorship, access to equipment, and other support in order to
                seed their moving-image projects. Five of <a href="http://alliedmedia.org/dna/projects">these
                    projects</a> have now moved into the second round of DNA and their makers were provided a fellowship
                to develop short films and accompanying community impact strategies.</p>
            <p>There are three documentaries and two narrative projects that each focus on different narratives about
                Detroit, including resisting displacement and foreclosures, connecting the ’80s sanctuary movement with
                today’s immigrant justice work, Black land sovereignty, public transportation, and uplifting the
                experiences of Black trans women. The filmmakers come out of the communities that they are representing
                in their projects, and are intentionally partnering with social justice organizations and activists in
                the creation and distribution of their projects to create a greater impact. For example, one of the
                DNA-supported narrative projects, <em>Riding With Aunt D. Dot,</em> uses magical realism and
                experimental elements to<em> </em>highlight the culture and community that exists on Detroit buses,
                destigmatizing public transportation users and raising critical questions about mobility and equity in
                our region. As part of their impact strategy, the filmmakers Bree Gant and Hanniyeh Cross are bus riders
                who are partnering with the Transit Justice Team, a program of Detroit People’s Platform that fights for
                racial justice in public transportation policies in Detroit.</p>
            <p>Ecosystem-building is a cornerstone to our work. One of the needs we identified in our feedback sessions
                was connecting the media professionals, organizers, and community members in our network, as well as
                providing structure and space to build those relationships over time.</p>
            <p>DNA has also experimented with using cultural <a href="https://youtu.be/fA-TQS-4xCk?t=1205">community
                    benefits agreements</a> (CBA) in partnerships with other cultural institutions (MIT’s Open Doc Lab
                and Co-Creation Studio, for example). This model of creating intentional partnerships and ensuring that
                these partnerships truly benefit community members affected by narrative work is rooted in our purpose.
                Early on in this work, the need for these practices was articulated by community members desiring deeper
                agency and inclusion in narrative work about the city. This can be as simple as prioritizing specific
                caterers and venues for meetings, creating explicit expectations of participation, and advocating for
                fair compensation when needed. This work is not new. Detroiters have been organizing around CBAs for new
                corporations and entities attempting to enter and profit off of the city. In Hollywood, there is already
                precedent for the work DNA is doing on a community level. Inclusion Riders, which Frances McDormand
                mentioned in her <a
                    href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/inclusion-rider-might-be-a-new-phrase-but-the-idea-has-been-working-for-a-while/2018/03/08/0bf6efc2-22e4-11e8-badd-7c9f29a55815_story.html?utm_term=.5996f8412a08">Academy
                    Award acceptance speech</a>, prove that mechanisms similar to the CBA are already in place and are
                under-utilized in the industry.</p>
            <p>We understand our work as part of a Detroit legacy of fighting for marginalized people to gain access to
                resources and opportunities that have been systematically denied by the institutions of philanthropy,
                professional media, and technology industries. It is also in our cultural heritage to be dynamic and
                prolific media-makers, through moving-image, sound, music, writing, and beyond. Our role is to find
                solutions that mitigate and react to biases while advancing deeper structural change.</p>
            <p>We encourage anyone thinking through these issues to focus on what it means to build equity into a
                process from the outset and intentionally hold space for marginalized communities and media makers. It
                won’t look like our work and it shouldn’t, as every space and situation involves its own unique context
                that must be considered with intention. In many ways, the root of the work is in acknowledging that no
                model is perfect. There is no equity panacea, and we’ve got to make our best attempt anyway. Our best
                advice on how to start is to begin by listening.</p>
