            <h3 id="a497">Insights from two panels interrogating definitions of the metaverse and preconditions for
                artistic flourishing within it</h3>
            <p>In Neal Stephenson’s dystopian novel <em>Snow Crash</em>, which takes place in the aftermath of a
                worldwide economic collapse, the<em> </em>metaverse was a parallel virtual world only accessible to the
                techno-elite. People escape from their harsh reality to the metaverse by wearing goggles and earphones
                and appear as their own customized avatar. Sounds familiar? This metaverse was overrun with corporate
                advertising. Stephenson was warning how massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) worlds
                could evolve.</p>
            <p>During the Double Exposure Investigative Film Festival &amp; Symposium in October 2021, the MIT Open
                Documentary Lab and <em>Immerse </em>partnered to present two panels titled “Making the Metaverse,”
                after this current issue’s theme.</p>
            <p>The first panel, “Case Studies,” moderated by <em>Immerse </em>editor Abby Sun, featured three pioneering
                makers describing their latest projects. <strong>Sparsh Ahuja</strong> presented on <a
                    href="https://projectdastaan.org/">Project Dastaan’s</a> outreach activities, reconnecting 1947
                India-Pakistan Partition migrants to their ancestral homes via 360 VR. <strong>Violeta Ayala</strong>
                showcased her Cryptovoxels digital gallery, where her collective, <a
                    href="https://www.koa.xyz/">KOA.xyz</a>, exhibits information about their projects, including the VR
                animation <em>Prison X</em>. Lastly, <strong>Robert Hernandez</strong>, shared his project <a
                    href="https://annenberg.usc.edu/current-students/jovrnalism">Jovrnalism</a>, which uses emerging
                technologies to produce digital journalism with his students at USC Annenberg. This dialogue set up the
                ground for the following panel.</p>

            <p>Moderated by Sarah Wolozin, Director of MIT Open Documentary Lab and a part of the <em>Immerse</em>
                editorial collective, the second panel brought together writers and journalists who provided insights
                into what is at stake within current debates on the metaverse and tried to make sense of our present
                locus. The panelists included <strong>Jesse Damiani</strong>, a writer who talked about the potential
                for journalists to cover this new space; <strong>Kathryn Karaoglu Hamilton, </strong>who addressed
                questions of control, representation, and access; and <strong>Andrew Wang</strong>, who shared his
                experience building community within the NFT’s ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Here are three takeaways that were shared between the two panels.</p>
            <h2 id="4795"><strong>1. The metaverse is a slippery term.</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Sarah Wolozin</strong>: The metaverse is hard to define. If you ask fifty people, you might get
                fifty definitions. It’s about virtual worlds, VR, AR, gaming and the interplay between virtual and
                physical worlds. Moreover, it’s about new decentralized financial ownership systems, blockchain, new
                identities, and new communities.</p>
            <p><strong>Abby Sun</strong>: In the technology-oriented point of view, the priority is on identities,
                avatars, objects, history and payments moving freely, but what about the movement of people, of memory,
                of dignity, and of time?</p>
            <p><strong>Jesse Damiani</strong>: It is like a wave. It’s moving, it’s evolving, and will be a tsunami.</p>
            <p><strong>Violeta Ayala</strong>: I’m going to define the metaverse the way I want to define it, and it
                will be a place where I can protest and where I can express my ideas.</p>
            <h2 id="089c"><strong>2. Accessibility and inclusion are crucial: creators can hijack Big Tech tools. But
                    the panelists disagreed about the conditions needed for their art, filmmaking, and journalism to
                    flourish in this space.</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Robert Hernandez</strong>: We found that what was really powerful is democratizing this
                technology [Snapchat Lens Studio] that is often held by companies with big resources and are viewed with
                corporate dollar signs, and we want to make sure that our diverse voices are included in that reality.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Violeta Ayala</strong>: If I want to share my trailer with someone, I just give them the exact
                coordinates [for the Cryptovoxels gallery] and they can click on the trailer. It has a real 3D
                representation and you can watch it and feel like you are sitting in a place. Audiences can understand a
                little bit more where I’m coming from, and how we create all the projects and characters.</p>
            <p><strong>Sparsh Ahuj</strong>a: [I care about] the extent to which one of the digital assets can be
                experienced without the individual user having to own a particular device. They could be projected onto
                public spaces without necessarily needing a headset or needing this specific phone or a specific bit of
                software. I think that’s the challenge of democratization — not everyone has a headset. So can we make
                the metaverse in a way that the individual user doesn’t need to actually own it?</p>
            <p><strong>Robert Hernandez</strong>: My framework is how affordable and accessible it is. Who can buy this
                software? How can I get a free or cheap version of it? And when I create something there, can I download
                it and put it into my own website or my own production platform?</p>
            <p><strong>Violeta Ayala</strong>: For me decentralization is the future. Within a decentralized world, I am
                very hopeful.</p>
            <h2 id="e8c6"><strong>3. A diversity of voices and stories about the metaverse are indispensable. Who and
                    what are missing?</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Jesse Damiani</strong>: There is a need for different kinds of stories to be told about the
                metaverse. There’s a lot of technology, both from the hardware and software perspective, such as cloud
                infrastructure. I also think that it’s important to start to reframe how we think about the metaverse as
                a human-first thing. Eventually, in some future ideal, non-human and post-human entities might coexist
                in those spaces with us.</p>
            <p><strong>Kathryn Karaoglu Hamilton</strong>: I think Jesse is totally right that we need to have different
                kinds of stories being told. It’s not a tech story, it’s a culture story. But the people telling it are
                mostly tech journalists. How do we allow different people, from anthropologists to social critics,
                access to this space? Otherwise the stories are going to continue to be kind of cringey, because they
                will come from a single point of view. The demographic in the space is majority white, English-speaking
                men from Western Europe and the US. What is the technological barrier to entry for hacking and glitch in
                this space? Is the technological barrier to entry so high that we, the majority of people, will become
                consumers in a very superficial way rather than actually being able to access the underlying structures
                of this space?</p>
            <p><strong>Andrew Wang</strong>: The idea of yearning for the vast and endless sea is what the metaverse
                feels like right now. I think we still have a long way to go but it’s community-building on this drive
                to make a better society where people who have been on the margins can finally be centered. We have a
                chance to do this and do this right.</p>

            <h2 id="8a92"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>
            <p>Regardless of whether we are champions or skeptics of the metaverse, it is happening. When Wolozin asked
                the panelist about the role of journalists and nonfiction storytellers in this emerging land, Damiani
                expressed that he has noticed a “knee-jerk reaction [from writers] to just disregard it because it’s
                part of this frothy hype space.”</p>
            <p>He believes this is a missed opportunity because “this metaverse discussion is an occasion for
                sense-making and storytelling, which is what journalists and documentarians can uniquely do… Let’s bring
                up those critical questions, let’s try to understand those social communities.” Instead of trying to
                define the metaverse, Damiani encourages us to start making sense of “this messy moving collective
                experiment that’s occurring in real time.”</p>
