            <p><em>In </em>Immerse<em> issue #8, we heard from Diana Barrett of the Fledgling Fund about </em><a
                    href="https://immerse.news/virtual-reality-a-funders-perspective-8ab369a1e063">how and why she
                    supports nonfiction VR</a><em>. To continue the discussion, we asked producers and researchers what
                    questions they’ve got for funders of the field.</em></p>

                    href="http://www.linasrivastava.com/">CIEL</a><em> for weighing in:</em></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Are arts (and non-arts) funders getting together to devise pipelines of support for VR and
                    scaffolding for access, training, creative innovation and distribution pathways at the community
                    level? How might we encourage this?</li>
                <li>What discussions are happening among media funders to support creators and industry infrastructure
                    in lesser resourced regions globally?</li>
                <li>How can we create a more efficient marketplace for filmmakers to find and assess VR/immersive
                    technologists, and how can those technologists find more challenging and creative media projects to
                    work on?</li>
                <li>What’s being done to help support and provide financial infrastructure for independents in this
                    field — creators, strategists, advocates — especially those who are more vulnerable in this moment
                    of political violence and blatant prejudice?</li>
                <li>Are you gathering, and making publicly available, data about the demographics of who you are
                    allocating funding to, especially race/ethnicity and gender — and do you have a specific strategy to
                    support VR projects led by makers of various ethnicities, genders, classes, etc.?</li>
                <li>Could foundations partner with venture funds or angel funders to broaden the range of immersive
                    artists and producers who receive support? How can early investment in distribution and branding
                    models for independent VR just as the economic model for it forms help to insulate makers against
                    some of the pitfalls of the marketplace for independent documentary?</li>
                <li>As the hype cycle about VR as “empathy machine” begins to wane, have you begun to look at the
                    dangers of VR as a “voyeurism machine?”</li>
                <li>Is the field of interactive/immersive documentary contracting and consolidating? Feels like there
                    are far fewer opportunities for support in general for R+D, iteration, impact strategy, etc., but
                    especially for “new media.”</li>
                <li>Why fund VR without a thorough understanding of long-term socio-cultural &amp; neurobiological
                    effects? And if we fund projects, can we also fund related empirical research and conversations
                    around ethics?</li>
                <li>Should we sink a ton of resources into what could be a transitional technology? What are the costs
                    of investing in another “shiny thing” vs. more meaningful modes of engagement?</li>
            </ol>
