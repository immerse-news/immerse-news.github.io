            <p>Stephanie Pereira is the Director of <a href="https://www.newinc.org/">NEW INC</a>, a museum-led
                incubator, cofounded in 2013 by Lisa Phillips, Toby Devan Lewis Director, and Karen Wong. It is a
                not-for-profit platform that furthers the New Museum’s ongoing commitment to new art and ideas. NEW
                INC’s mission is to advance culture, engender an equitable environment for creative entrepreneurs, and
                drive social change.</p>
            <p>Entering its sixth year, NEW INC supports roughly 100 members working at the intersection of art, design,
                and technology — 50% of whom are women, and 50% are people of color — selected via an annual open call.
                The program includes a dedicated workspace, enrollment in a professional development program, and access
                to a mentor and alumni network of nearly 500 people.</p>
            <p>NEW INC’s members have raised $18M in investment or philanthropic donations, 175 related businesses have
                been created or retained in NYC, and more than 392 jobs have been created. Alumni include: Interactive

            <h3 id="ce3d"><strong>Can you give us a bit about your background?</strong></h3>
            <p>Prior to joining NEW INC, I was at Kickstarter for over six years. My background is in arts
                administration, so before Kickstarter, I’d worked in non-profit arts administration, most recently
                running, learning, and engagement at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center.</p>
            <h3 id="42b0"><strong>I’m curious to hear your thoughts on co-creation and on interdisciplinary practice.
                    What do you think works and doesn’t?</strong></h3>
            <p>I’ve been reading a book by a woman named Priya Parker called the <em>Art of Gathering</em>. The premise
                is: How do you bring together a community in a meaningful, transformative way? Who do you leave out ? I
                have organized many invite-only events — not to be exclusive but as a way to create a more productive
                environment, where you can set a very clear bar for participation and engagement. You don’t have to
                wonder about: How do I stretch to include all possible points of view?</p>
            <h3 id="4db1"><strong>Can you tell me how you define co-creation?</strong></h3>
            <p>The purpose of my thesis was to investigate opportunities for creating a museum space that was welcoming
                and inviting and felt alive, not like a mausoleum. I was a student at the School of the Art Institute of
                Chicago, which means that all my classes were right across from the Art Institute and I had free access.
                They have an incredible collection. So it was a no-brainer that I was going there and hanging out the
                galleries and looking at paintings.</p>
            <p>As I was spending more time there, I was noticing that most people don’t have that relationship with
                museums. Museums are set up in a very top-down way, where visitors are encouraged to be passive. It’s a
                paternalistic experience: These are the policies, these are the guidelines: “No eating, no drinking, no
                running, no …” I also have led many group tours. The first thing you do is tell everyone the rules: “You
                can’t get this close to the paintings. You can’t touch anything.”</p>
            <p>Through my thesis research, I had this question: “How do you design a co-created space?” The idea was
                that if people have actual agency in a space, they’ll have more of a meaningful relationship and
                connection. I studied the work of David Bohm, a physicist and philosopher who wrote a book called <em>On
                    Dialogue</em>. I studied Paulo Friere and his thinking around <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed,
                </em>his work with leveling the playing field for participation in a country like Brazil.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, Chicago is known as hyper-segregated; it’s very diverse but not integrated at all. As a
                New Yorker, it was the first thing I noticed. It’s very visible.</p>
            <p>I ended up creating a Little Arts Society, an arts adventure club. We would choose a place to visit, an
                art event or a museum. We would go and we’d agree as a group on the terms of engagement for the space
                and then we would take over the space in the way that we defined. For example, we might go to a show in
                a very traditional way, where we walk around and look at the work, but then we would have signs printed
                out that we would put in the café, so we would take it over and turn it into a place where we could talk
                about our experience and invite others to join us. Once we re-wrote museum maps based on what we were
                seeing. We created our own audio guides by recording what we saw and discussed, then uploaded them and
                sent out press releases that said, “Download an audio guide to the contemporary Chinese photography show
                at the MCA.”</p>
            <p>This is how we defined co-creation: We were creating something as a group, but we were also trying to
                create this messy, interstitial experience that anyone could also feel very invited to.</p>
            <h3 id="1eaa"><strong>Now that you’re out of museum work, how do you feel that your organization has
                    co-created and what are your visions for it?</strong></h3>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/205/398/0*2SAqQT8K1nVvuwQV" width="205"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span></figure>
            <p>A lot of museums, the way they define community engagement is through what they call “outreach,” which
                is: “We define a program, we decide the community needs us, we give them something they don’t have,”
                which is really, again, top down. It’s assuming that your community has nothing to bring or to offer.
                The New Museum has done many things in this way, but one of the things they’ve done is create NEW INC,
                which operates out of the space next door to the museum. It is an interdisciplinary community of about
                100 people working in art and design and technology. It is predicated on this idea of creating a space,
                a platform, a context for people to gather and co-create.</p>
            <p>I just did new member interviews, and we have about, I think, 17% returning this year. We said, “What was
                the best thing about working here this year?” Everyone said, “The community.” We pushed and said, “Tell
                us more about that.” They said, “Well, this person sits next to me and inevitably our work started to
                blend, or we decided to create this event together, or we did a research trip together…”</p>
            <p>You can have people from disparate practices and by putting them next to each other in an open space, you
                create a cross-pollination of thinking and perspectives. It’s not just about the actual work you create,
                but the way that you think about your work and see the world around you — all of it is informed by the
                experience.</p>
            <h3 id="b3ef"><strong>Can you tell me a little bit about the landscape of incubators in these kinds of
                    spaces?</strong></h3>
            <p>We think NEW INC is the first museum-led incubator. Traditionally, a lot of incubators come out of the
                business sector or private/public sector, where the bottom line is always: “If we support these
                individuals, these businesses, it will make our economy stronger.”</p>
            <p>The museum’s incubator is about creating a space where people from different disciplines and backgrounds
                can come together to help advance their fields in some way. We’re going to advance culture and also make
                a space that’s equitable, opening up the field and who’s participating.</p>
            <p>NEW INC was the first organization to put a stake in the ground five years ago around that. We’ve since
                seen many more museums do this. We’ve seen cities do this, universities have gotten into the game. At
                universities, it’s a mix in terms of the model: Is it on the business side? Is it on the cultural side?
                I think this idea of a cultural incubator is a global thing.</p>
            <h3 id="e0b6"><strong>What about residencies? Do you know of examples in tech companies or at scientific
                    institutions?</strong></h3>
            <p>I think the Autodesk residency is the most well-known. They have a purpose-built space that’s quite
                fantastic, because of all the incredible tools and machines at your fingertips. As a fabrication studio
                and as a prototyping studio — as a place to play — it’s quite exciting. It’s unusual to the extent of
                what it provides, but it is pretty typical of businesses offering residencies in that it’s about
                bringing artists in to play and then seeing how they use the tools differently, see how they use the
                services differently, see how they influence or inform the workforce.</p>
            <p>Microsoft also has a residency program. When they invite an artist in to play with their new technology,
                they’re also learning from how artists use it, so that they can further refine things. We have a
                partnership with Bell Labs, which is the pure research arm of Nokia, at this point. The purpose of the
                Bell residency is to invite fresh energy into the space to actively collaborate. There’s been a long
                history of this with Bell. Robert Rauschenberg was one of the artists they worked with. Motion capture
                was invented at Bell Labs. You have new technology created at this intersection of artists and engineers
                and scientists working together.</p>
            <h3 id="ef05"><strong>What’s the difference between an incubator and a residency?</strong></h3>
            <p>Residencies, in my experience, tend to be project-based, although they don’t have to be. I think that the
                commonality is that it is a development opportunity. They have five months, three months, one week, a
                period of focused time on a project.</p>
            <p>A core difference at an incubator is that you pay for a desk. It is a space where you do work rather than
                being invited in to work on a creative project in an open-ended way. The idea is that this is part of
                your business practice. You’re paying for a desk and then we also provide professional development — so
                everything from identifying your core values to defining your mission statement. Our bootcamp starts
                with the base: Who you are, what are you trying to do, and then all the way up through details like IP
                or incorporation or finances.</p>
            <h3 id="7e10"><strong>What are the limitations of a highly commercial space? Can it be detrimental to
                    co-creation?</strong></h3>
            <p>When you come into a space like this and you have all these incredible resources, the reality is that
                people have a huge concern: “How do I pay my bills?”</p>
            <p>It really does limit your freedom to play, and especially in an incubator where the purpose of this place
                is to develop and refine your model. Whereas, when I worked at Eyebeam, where the whole purpose was to
                immerse yourself in the space of your project and the community there, it created a different kind of
                space. I think what we’re trying to do at NEW INC is to figure out how to negotiate that and open that
                up.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/268/0*kLPuwcntczUNa0Ie.jpeg" width="800"><label

                    ethical and inclusive movement to counter existing startup and venture capital culture.”</span>
            </figure>
            <p>Interestingly, there’s a lot of this conversation happening in the social impact space. Jennifer Brandel
                co-wrote “<a href="https://medium.com/@sexandstartups/zebrasfix-c467e55f9d96">The Zebra Manifesto</a>,”
                which was a call to action to redefine what success looks like in a business. I served as an advisor on
                that. They organize a conference in the fall called Dazzlecon, where about 400 attendees come and talk
                about their experiments in this way. None of those people who attended were artists. It’s interesting to
                see how this conversation is totally passing the art world by.</p>
            <h3 id="7d3a"><strong>Is there a role for public media in redefining itself in terms of supporting
                    co-creation?</strong></h3>
            <p>Kamal Sinclair talked about this in <a href="https://makinganewreality.org/">Making a New Reality</a>.
                Instead of just having one public television channel that broadcasts stuff, public media could have
                created a context for people to come together, to really broaden that funnel of who gets to participate.
                I know this is a big part of what they think about at POV The folks at National Endowment for the
                Humanities, too. I think the other thing is broadening their scope — understanding that media is film
                and video and audio and games…</p>
            <h3 id="c226"><strong>It’s not just the content. It’s also the platform.</strong></h3>
            <p>Yeah…Despite the promise of the internet that we can all be media makers, I think that we’re slipping
                back into a mode of consuming. When I worked at Eyebeam, there was a moment where it felt like the world
                was ours for the taking, where the internet provided this opportunity to re-define the world around us.
            </p>
            <p>Someone actually Tweeted, “I miss all the weird websites and Uncle Bob’s blog.” Do you remember that? Do
                remember when all the websites looked different and everyone had strange blogs or strange internet
                projects? Now it’s like everything’s been sort of congregated on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and then
                there are micro-influencers who have mass audiences that they’re projecting out to. Everything looks the
                same. It feels very the same.</p>
            <p>I think there’s a huge opportunity to unlock with co-creation. People have to feel like they are party to
                the creation of the world around them. When I was running my youth programs, the underlying theme for
                three years was, “Seeing the city as an editable interface.” That was my takeaway working with all these
                young people — that they don’t see it that way. They see it as a given. We would go up on the High Line
                and they would be nervous to do anything but walk that path. They had no sense that they could deviate
                from that path.</p>
