            <p>“You have to be a human before you’re a photographer or documentarian,” filmmaker Alexander Glustrom says
                in an <a href="https://www.workingfilms.org/story-shift/mossville/">interview with Working Films</a>.

            <p>In September, Working Films debuted <a href="http://storyshift.net">Story</a><em><a
                        href="http://storyshift.net">Shift</a></em>, a program aimed at sharing the approaches of
                filmmakers who use co-creative practices in their work. Through interviews and resource sharing,
                Story<em>Shift</em> is opening up a conversation around authentic representation of people in
                documentary films. Hannah Hearn, the impact coordinator at Working Films, explains, “We were really
                trying to lift up lessons learned and advice from those filmmakers.”</p>
            <p>These aims resonate with themes raised in the field study <a
                    href="https://wip.pubpub.org/collectivewisdom">Collective Wisdom</a>, in which similar questions of
                justice framed the conversations with documentarians: For what purpose are you capturing a story? For
                whose benefit? What are your responsibilities as an “outside” observer?</p>

                    Always in Season, featuring Jacqueline Olive (filmmaker) and Claudia Lacy (featured in the
                    film)</span></figure>
            <p>StoryShift showcases the documentary <em>Always in Season</em>, in which filmmaker Jacqueline Olive uses
                a genuinely collaborative approach to represent the history of African-American lynchings and the
                present-day story of Lennon Lacy, a 17-year-old found hanging from a swing set in 2014 in Bladenboro,
                North Carolina. Olive notes, “I don’t ever use the term ‘subject.’ It reflects the power dynamics of
                colonialism. You have this gaze when you talk about subjects, and too often, it’s done with people of
                color.”</p>
            <p>In her Story<em>Shift</em> interview, Olive describes her drive to get to know the people she films,
                contrasting her approach with that of the “media dropping in and dropping out of Bladenboro.”</p>
            <p>Claudia Lacy, featured in <em>Always in Season</em>, discusses her experience of this process in a
                Story<em>Shift</em> interview. She explains, “When [Olive] allowed to let me know that she had a
                17-year-old and was a single mother, she could relate because there is something there, that bond
                between a mother and a child, that you never leave… She didn’t really have to tell me. ” In her
                Story<em>Shift</em> interview, Lacy also notes that Olive was able to use her compassion and position as
                a filmmaker to help her learn more information about her son’s investigation than she was able to obtain
                on her own.</p>

            <p>Community members and filmmakers are demanding that more questions about ethics surface in documentary
                filmmaking. What responsibilities do filmmakers have to the people whose stories they are representing?
                How should a filmmaker protect the privacy and integrity of the people they’re representing on screen?
                What kinds of benefits should the filmmaking process offer its participants? These are complex questions
                with answers that might differ from one film to the next. Importantly, these are also questions that
                cannot be addressed by filmmakers alone.</p>
            <p>Natalie Bullock Brown, lead strategist of StoryShift, explained, “We hope that this work will not only
                impact filmmakers but also expand to funders, juries… and every axis of this industry, that this issue
                of accountability will resonate in ways that it currently doesn’t.”</p>
            <p>Brown further highlighted that she is passionate about funding as an access point. For the Working Films
                funding process, filmmakers have to answer questions about their accountability practices. During this
                process, Working Films may also bring in outside panelists who have experience with a particular story
                they’re considering. She pointed this out as a counterexample to funding situations in which, “white
                filmmakers can get a full budget to tell the story of a community of color, in particular, a black
                community, and not have crew members or advisors or anyone that looks like the community.”</p>
            <p>When it comes to influencing popular narratives and shifting audience expectations, however, it’s clear
                that even ethical filmmaking and funding are not sufficient. While discussing the role of the broader
                ecosystem around documentary films, Brown cited <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/opinion/we-need-more-critics-of-color.html">“The Dominance
                    of the White Male Critic,”</a> a <em>New York Times</em> op-ed in which Elizabeth Méndez and Chi-hui
                Yang highlight the impact of racial inequities in representation among film critics. Brown emphasized
                how important it is for people of diverse backgrounds, experiences, and voices to have spots on film
                festival selection panels. She explains, “Different people are going to have different lenses [to] see
                the importance of a variety of stories.” Films responsibly, authentically depicting real-world stories
                may face hurdles to exposure if critics and film festival panelists are not equipped with a diversity of
                viewpoints to receive them.</p>
            <p>To address these concerns, Story<em>Shift</em> is expanding beyond online videos, including interactive
                panels at film festivals and sharing online resources. By sharing filmmaking insights, compiling
                resources, and bringing the discussion to film festivals, Story<em>Shift</em> aims to make space for
                co-creation across the entire lifetime of a film.</p>
