            <h3 id="dfd5"><strong>VR and AR are opening up new paths for makers and museums</strong></h3>
            <p>For arts institutions, the quest to engage new patrons is a never-ending one.</p>
            <p>Each generation brings new expectations of how the world is supposed to “just work,” shaped by the
                technologies they have grown up with, along with a desire for the new and novel that emerging
                technologies can sometimes provide.</p>
            <p>Enter stage right immersive technology — virtual, augmented, and mixed reality — with the tantalizing
                promise of being the “next big thing.” While fits and starts in the consumer adoption of these tools
                have turned the gadget-obsessed tech press from bullish to bearish, the actual potential of immersive
                tech as a medium has only begun to be unlocked.</p>
            <p>Both established and emerging cultural institutions are turning to design techniques which leverage these
                technologies — mixing them with tried-and-true theatrical, architectural, and even retail design
                principles — to create transformative experiences for patrons.</p>
            <p><em>Carne Y Arena</em>, which won a special Academy Award in 2017 after a tour that included stops in
                Cannes and Los Angeles, leveraged both VR and physical immersive design to bring attendees into a
                re-creation of a migrant border crossing in the American Southwest. Cutting-edge VR was used to deliver
                the primary experience, but the large-scale set framed the story in a way that brought patrons closer to
                the visceral details that defined the reality for those who lived it.</p>

            <p>Attendees of <em>Carne Y Arena</em> began their journey in a re-creation of a “cooler” — the extremely
                low-temperature rooms that undocumented migrants are often held in by Border Patrol. There they took off
                their shoes, placed them in a locker on the wall, and waited for a red light to signal that they could
                pass through an austere metal door. Beyond the door was a large, dimly lit sandbox with a looming border
                fence. This image was made all the more striking by the coldness of the sand squishing between toes clad
                only in nylon booties. Every step of this process happened before participants were helped into a mobile
                VR rig by two attendants, making the immersive tech only part of the immersive experience.</p>
            <p>Large-scale installations like <em>Carne Y Arena</em> grab headlines and awards, but they’re not the only
                way that arts institutions can engage with the emerging art forms, as Kellian Adams Pletcher of
                experience design company <a href="https://www.greendoorlabs.com/">Green Door Labs</a> in Boston points
                out.</p>
            <p>“There are a lot of ways to build immersive tech or experiences with whatever you have,” said Pletcher,
                “It’s just a matter of using your resources and adjusting expectations. Museums can do weird things.
                They can experiment. People donate things like time and resources to museums so… if [museums] are
                willing to be a little daring they could probably get a lot more than they think for their money.”</p>
            <p>Pletcher’s firm works with museums and educational institutions to craft interactive experiences for
                patrons. The technologies she employs aren’t always of the headline-grabbing variety, taking advantage
                of what her clients have available. “Usually the most useful things museums will have is a good wifi
                connection and a bunch of iPads, which is pretty handy,” she said.</p>
            <p>Yet the point of leveraging technology is to create a great experience for patrons, not just run down a
                checklist of the latest gadgets. For Pletcher the key is deploying the technology in context.</p>

                        Door Labs)</strong></span></figure>
            <p>“When I did <em><a href="https://www.greendoorlabs.com/new-page-3">Mustaches and Mayhem</a></em><em>
                </em>at the Smithsonian Castle, we used a really simple text-based mobile web program to get people
                through the story and puzzles hidden throughout the castle. This made things much more flexible, and
                tech works as a nice lock so you don’t have to use a million padlocks. Sometimes institutions will pull
                me on to build a custom digital experience. The <a href="https://www.greendoorlabs.com/avatar">Peabody
                    Essex Museum</a> asked us to make an ‘avatar guesser.’ ” This was a touchscreen game that dove into
                the relationship between online profiles and real-world identities. Pletcher said that when her clients
                “want an interactive experience I almost always just use off-the-shelf-programs and integrate it with
                real-space design.”</p>
            <p>Sometimes the most immersive way to deploy technology is to hide it away where no one can see it. When
                done properly, the effects can be magical. This can be seen at popular escape rooms like New Orleans’ <a
                    href="https://escapemyroom.com/">Escape My Room</a>. DeLaporte Ventures, the company behind Escape
                My Room, recently opened an attraction for the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas called <em><a
                        href="https://escape-extinction.com/">Escape Extinction: Sharks</a></em><em>,</em> which mixes
                escape room puzzles, actors, and exhibit design to provide an engaging and educational experience.</p>
            <p>“Often we try to stay away from front-facing technology,” said DeLaporte’s founder Andrew Preeble, who
                doesn’t “like to use screens unless they are a stand-in for something which we otherwise wouldn’t be
                able to do.”</p>
            <p>As in theme park design, the goal isn’t to sell people on the value of the technology, but to use the
                technology to give them the best experience possible. In these cases a little slight of hand assisted by
                existing technology can go a long way. Yet sometimes experience designers want to jump straight into the
                latest and greatest technology, or maybe just want to take advantage of the fact that people are always
                on their phones anyway, so why not meet them where they already are?</p>

                    from Meow Wolf’s Anomaly Tracker</span></figure>
            <p>Santa Fe’s <a href="https://meowwolf.com/">Meow Wolf</a>, which has turned the art world on its ear with
                its immersive art installations, doesn’t shy away from the cutting edge of mixed reality tech. An app —
                the <a href="https://santafe.meowwolf.com/anomaly/">Anomaly Tracker</a> — adds another layer to the
                already rich House of Eternal Return. The free phone app lets visitors tune into augmented reality
                extensions of installations inside the home, playing into the multiversal mythology the collective has
                built for their work.</p>
            <p>In a similar vein, <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/play-app/">Disney’s Play</a>
                app adds a layer of game interaction to their theme parks, a feature which has been put front-and-center
                in the <em>Star Wars </em>themed expansion that opened at Disneyland and will soon be at Walt Disney
                World. Both apps take advantage of the social norms around phone usage, and the ways in which audiences
                — particularly younger audiences — have been conditioned by games such as Pokemon Go, which drape a
                digital narrative layer on top of the physical world.</p>
            <p>Yet you don’t have to be a multi-billion dollar corporation, or an arts collective rapidly expanding into
                multiple regions, in order to create an app.</p>
            <p>Visual artist <a href="https://nancybakercahill.com/">Nancy Baker Cahill</a> has an app of her own, <a
                    href="https://nancybakercahill.com/4th-wall-ar-app">4th Wall</a>, which she uses to deploy AR
                versions of her work at venues around the world. Cahill’s visual work has long featured vortexes —
                swirling masses of force constructed out of fragmentary strokes. In mixed reality the pieces reach
                titanic proportions, with the AR versions often hovering in the sky over the scene as if they were
                supernaturally charged storms. “I feel I am reaching a broader audience, and one that wouldn’t
                traditionally self-identify as being art-enthusiastic,” said Cahill. The app, she told us, has opened up
                new possibilities for her work.</p>

            <p>“It’s been very liberating for me in terms of being able to act swiftly and nimbly, not waiting for
                ‘permission to do certain things, and to reach out directly to and collaborate with other artists I
                respect. It is, though, by its nature, inviting audience engagement outside the walls of traditional
                institutions by inviting viewers to specific sites, and also by putting the choice of where and how they
                experience art in their own hands.”</p>
            <p>She’s also found herself in conversations with institutions interested in collaborating, “which I am open
                to, provided it looks outward versus in.”</p>
            <p>While having an app isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution — indeed, Cahill points out that access to the
                technology is an issue that needs to be addressed, one that institutions could play a role in making
                more equitable — even the access and distribution problems can lead to positive experiences.</p>
            <p>“There have also been magical moments where spontaneous bonds, connections, and conversations occur
                between and among strangers when one person <em>does</em> have access to the app and is willing to share
                it, or the experience of it, with the people around them. This is part of the unexpected magic of
                immersive tech and the audiences you could not possibly have imagined existing, fleeting as they may
                be.“</p>
            <p>There are a number of roles that established institutions can play — from patron of the technologically
                enhanced arts to bridger of the digital divide — but the first one is always as connector to their
                communities, as Green Door Lab’s Pletcher argues.</p>
            <p>“Sometimes I get the feeling that museums are like ‘If you build it, someone will come’ rather than
                saying ‘Amateur classical musicians, this is for you.’ ” Look at how <em>many</em> people go to (gaming
                convention) PAX East, but Boston museums don’t leverage that by building any PAX-related programming.
                There’s a lot of power in these little communities — I see a lot of unexplored opportunities. If they’d
                look at specific audience first and then built an immersive, interactive experience for them I think
                they’d get a really interesting response.”</p>
            <p>Which brings us to the first — and last — principle of immersive design: know your audience, and know
                what relationship you’re looking to foster between them and the work. No matter the technology deployed,
                the principle remains.</p>
