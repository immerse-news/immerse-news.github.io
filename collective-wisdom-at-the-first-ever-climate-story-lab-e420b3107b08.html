            <p><em>By Katerina Cizek</em></p>
            <p>The climate crisis is a top reason to co-create, according to our new <em><a
                        href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/collectivewisdom">Collective Wisdom</a></em> study.</p>
            <p>We were honoured to present our findings at the first ever <a
                    href="https://docsociety.org/climate-story-lab/">Climate Story Lab</a>, run by Doc Society and
                Exposure Labs in New York City in July. This extraordinary week-long event brought together <a
                    href="https://docsociety.org/climate-story-lab/">12 climate-related media projects</a>, along with
                more than 200 activists, scholars, policy experts and climate defenders, to meld minds on the challenges
                of Climate Justice.</p>
            <p>The links between co-creation and climate justice ran through the program and design. Here are only a few
                of the co-creative principles that surfaced throughout my one day there: moving beyond the traps of the
                single author, the single discipline, the single organization and even single species.</p>
            <p>“We need to de-centre the human” in our understanding of the planet, said Jade Begay, Creative Director
                at <a href="https://ndncollective.org/">NDN Collective</a>. She delivered the morning land
                acknowledgement, reminding us that the word “Mahatta” means “island of many hills” and might have looked
                much like Yellowstone Park in pre-colonial times.</p>

            <p>“Collective authorship” was key to the viral video<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9uTH0iprVQ">
                </a><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9uTH0iprVQ">A Message From the Future With Alexandria
                        Ocasio-Cortez</a></em>, according to Avi Lewis, one of the makers, along with Naomi Klein, Molly
                Crabapple, and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. He said at the Lab: ”We need to tell the truth, make them laugh,
                and show them a vision of the future they can get motivated by now.”</p>

            <p>“Utopian visioning is the left version of the right’s conspiracy theories,” responded Alex O’Keefe of the
                <a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/">Sunrise Movement</a>.
            </p>
            <p>“Climate Justice is linked to participatory democracy,” said Sarra Tekola, PhD Student, School of
                Sustainability at Arizona State University and Climate Activist.</p>
            <p>Brenda Coughlin of the Sundance Institute reminded us that not one film, one media project can do the
                full heavy lift to achieve Climate Justice. The spirit of the lab brought together 12 media projects
                that might have, in the past been seen in the conventional media industry as competitive rather than
                collaborative. Brenda stressed that our processes and projects need to remain iterative, and seen as
                parts of a larger whole.</p>

            <p>Working Films presented <a href="https://www.workingfilms.org/projects/storyshift/">Story Shift</a>
                initiative, a new effort<a href="https://www.workingfilms.org/projects/storyshift/"> </a>to share and
                promote co-created best practices for non-extractive storytelling. And Jess Search of Doc Society
                discussed how <a href="https://rebellion.earth/">Extinction Rebellion</a> (XR) is converting suburban
                grandmothers into unlikely &amp; effective protesters, sparking a new<a

                    “summer uprising” in five UK cities</a>.</p>
            <p>Co-Creation Studio closed out the first day with findings from our <em>Collective Wisdom</em> field
                study, which summed up that co-creation and climate justice are inextricably entwined. While we need to
                move towards a climate just future, we also need to challenge ourselves to a more equitable form of
                media making.</p>
