            <h2 id="ce9e">Designing Flux</h2>
            <p>For the past six years I have been working on <em>Flux</em>, an interactive documentary about
                deconstructing gender. The project originated from my personal desire to imagine an alternative society
                where gender is not linked to biological sex. Can we liberate ourselves from expectations based on our
                physical appearances? Can we change what society mirrors back to us? Can we become aware of the biased
                roles we unconsciously take? With <em>Flux </em>we hope to ignite an active reflection process and,
                consequently, an inclusive dialogue about new ways to relate to each other.</p>
            <p>The interactive documentary will take the form of an app or a website. Its setting is a journey into a
                virtual society called “Flux.” In Flux, gender is not determined by biological sex. Instead, people have
                fluctuating levels of masculine and feminine energies that change in response to different relationships
                and contexts. Gender is a flow. The idea was inspired by the 1969 science fiction novel <em>The Left
                    Hand of Darkness</em> by Ursula K. Le Guin.</p>
            <p>Most of the documentary characters that inhabit Flux want to be free from their biological sex in one way
                or another. They want to be seen as people. For example, there is performance artist Marie, who is
                trying to remove her programmed gender through hypnosis. There is a tattoo artist, Natalia, who is
                perplexed because she chose to physically be a woman and feels strongly connected to other women but
                doesn’t feel the urge to have children. And bio-artist Tristan, who sees his body as a constantly
                shifting organism on a micro as well as a macro scale.</p>

            <p>When you enter <em>Flux,</em> an omnipresent a-gendered voice guides your journey: <em>“</em>Welcome
                traveler. We are Flux. We have many shapes and colors, but together we are one. We are always changing.
                We are me.”<em> </em>The voice is layered and electronically manipulated, so it won’t sound completely
                human. In <em>Flux</em> everyone is seen as interconnected. The voice reflects this. Visually, the style
                is a bit psychedelic, built of kaleidoscopic graphics with fluctuating colors. At an early stage of the
                project, someone referred to it as “a very feminine universe.” At the time, I subconsciously took it as
                an insult for some reason. Later, I surrendered to this idea and embraced it.</p>

            <p>At the beginning of the experience you are asked to create a shape based on a self-evaluation of your
                personality traits. The shape becomes an avatar representing you. The characters in Flux are also
                represented by shapes based on their personality traits. You will view clips of characters that have
                more or less likeness to you. The voice continuously comments on your interactions and acknowledges your
                presence.</p>
            <p>It is an open story world that can be explored freely within a timed framework. An initial journey in
                <em>Flux</em> will take 10–15 minutes. You will be asked to take part in an experiment exploring the
                concepts of masculinity and femininity. The central questions are: How do we perceive others (the
                characters)? And what does that say about us?
            </p>

                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="14503396174387691875">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="14503396174387691875"><span class="marginnote">Graphics
                    mockup for the ‘energy level’ screen (not final)</span></figure>
            <p>In the “experiment” you will be asked to share your perception of the characters of masculine and
                feminine energy levels. This will be done by comparing them to each other, since gender is seen as
                relational in Flux. You also have to place yourself in relation to the characters. Note that it is not a
                scientific experiment but part of the story experience. The data you enter will be anonymized, saved,
                and used to build your personal profile, which is revealed when the journey ends. For example, you will
                see your own feminine and masculine energy levels, based on how you perceived the characters. You will
                also discover how much your understanding of masculinity and femininity deviates from the norm
                established by all other players’.</p>
            <p>The end goal of the experience is to create awareness of our own gendered programming through an active
                reflection process. The interactive format allows for this to happen in a playful way. It engages us on
                a personal level, because we have to actively relate to the people on screen and ourselves.</p>
            <p>When we started this project in 2013 there wasn’t any significant discussion about gender in the media.
                In fact, the producer of <em>Flux</em> and I had to humorously excuse ourselves for presenting a
                “feminist” project at pitch forums. As we progressed, the media’s focus on gender has increased
                exponentially. At least in Denmark, where we are based, the media has been overflowing with stories of
                queer identities in recent years. This development has only made the project more relevant, because
                users outside of the queer circles are more open to receive it. We certainly don’t have to excuse
                ourselves anymore.</p>
            <p>As a first step, Flux will be published in October 2019 at a special exhibition in <a
                    href="http://kvindemuseet.dk/">Kvindemuseet (The Women’s Museum)</a> in Aarhus, Denmark. An entire
                floor of the museum will be transformed into an immersive journey into <em>Flux</em>. In our current
                plans, there will be a tunnel with an audio installation (we call it a “birthing canal”) that you walk
                through, leading to a dimly lit room. In the room you will be able to sit in a circle around an
                artificial campfire and play the interactive documentary. When you exit the room, there will be a
                participatory activity, where you can share ideas for an alternative society. In an adjacent room there
                will be a multi-sensorial part of the exhibition where visitors can discover objects belonging to the
                Flux characters (see, smell, or touch) while listening to short audio stories belonging to each of the
                objects. Note that <em>Flux </em>is still a work-in-progress, so many of the features mentioned above
                can still change.</p>
            <p><em>Flux</em> is produced by House of Real and was developed with support from MIT Open Documentary Lab,
                The Danish Film Institute, Sundance New Frontier, The Arcus Foundation, Aarhus Interactive and AVEK. We
                are currently trying to raise completion funding and are relying on volunteer work for the time being.
