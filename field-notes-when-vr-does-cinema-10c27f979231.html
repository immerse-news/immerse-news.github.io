            <h3 id="9c62">Observations from Festival du Nouveau Cinéma</h3>
            <p>Recently, I’ve been thinking about how one’s understanding of VR greatly depends on one’s first encounter
                with the medium.</p>
            <p>My first experiences with VR were all at film festivals — specifically, Festival du Nouveau Cinéma (FNC)
                in Montreal. For the past few years, FNC has curated a series of VR works in its eXPlore section
                (including cinematic, interactive, location-based, etc.) with a focus on making these new media
                experiences accessible to the general public. Considering VR devices are only just now making their way
                into households, it’s interesting to see how FNC chooses to present VR to people who wouldn’t have a
                chance to see it otherwise. Because FNC remains primarily a film festival, I’ve also been curious to see
                whether and how FNC eXPlore opens up to experiences that challenge the moniker of “cinema.”</p>

            <h3 id="17eb"><strong>Accessibility</strong></h3>
            <p>To make VR accessible to the general public, FNC hosts its VR selection in the middle of a mall, next to
                the food court, completely free of cost. A sponsorship from Samsung outfits the festival with a
                collection of smartphone-powered “Gear VR” headsets, which, although not as powerful as the Rifts and
                Vives of the world, are plenty to showcase the majority of works each year that fall under the category
                of “cinematic VR” (360° videos in all but name).</p>

            <p>In past years, each head-mounted display was dedicated to a single film, which meant a lot of waiting in
                line. For the 2019 edition, all cinematic VR works were loaded on to every headset to cut wait times and
                ensure anyone passing by on their lunch break or doing errands had equal opportunity to see the films.

                    Thierry Loa</span></figure>
            <p>One project in this space was shown on separate Oculus Go headsets, <em>21–22 Alpha</em> by Thierry Loa.
                The first in an ongoing series of VR films, <em>21–22 Alpha</em> deals with the Anthropocene by
                contrasting images from pristine landscapes with shots of major urban developments that confront the
                viewer with humankind’s profound impact on the planet. Using a series of drone shots and no narration
                (save for a few opening and closing words) Loa’s film stands out from the VR selections of years past by
                using VR’s ability to foster a sense of presence for reasons other than putting the viewer in the body
                of a character in a narrative.</p>
            <p>Based on what I’ve seen at FNC eXPlore, cinematic VR seems to have moved on from the gimmicks of years
                past and beyond the conventions inherited from narrative cinema in favour of more subtle strategies for
                immersing viewers in spaces that would otherwise be inaccessible to them. <em>The Rain That is Falling
                    Now Was Also Falling Back Then</em>, by Christian Zipfel, falls in a similar category by documenting
                the lives of three men in Botoșani prison, Romania. Zipfel, who brought us <em>Rooms</em> last year,
                continues his project of showcasing spaces typically hidden behind closed doors and the rituals that
                govern them. <em>The Rain</em> offers a glimpse into the daily routines of the three men trying to make
                life bearable inside the prison, considering the challenges they’ll face once they leave.</p>

                    Immersive Oratorio, by Lena Herzog.</span></figure>
            <p>One last VR film is worth mentioning, as it won the “Prix Cinema VR.” <em>Last Whispers: an Immersive
                    Oratorio </em>by Lena Herzog is presented as an invocation of languages that are either extinct or
                on the verge of disappearing. The film focuses on audio from these languages with sober visuals — a
                black-and-white representation of the globe seen from within — that back up the spoken words. For the
                majority of the experience, the Earth rotates around the viewer and points light up on the map with the
                name for the corresponding languages. I must agree with Alex Ross, a critic for <em>The New Yorker</em>,
                who fittingly described <em>Last Whispers</em> as “a very haunting and singular experience.”</p>
            <h3 id="b6b9"><strong>“Immersive VR”</strong></h3>
            <p>More works still were tucked away in another venue (a nearby university campus) and assembled under the
                banner of “immersive VR” (confusing as that name may be).</p>
            <p>Put simply, these were interactive pieces that ran the gamut from small games and interactive narratives
                to a variety of takes on the documentary format. The two most notable titles, in my experience, were
                <em>Another Dream</em> by Tamara Shogaolu and <em>Common Ground</em> by Darren Emerson. The former uses
                animation to tell the story of an Egyptian lesbian couple who fled Cairo to escape oppression. Here,
                once more, VR serves to supplement what the two subjects of the piece are telling us about their
                experience; the animated spaces illustrate and clarify what they describe without diminishing the power
                of their words. Although limited in terms of interactivity, <em>Another Dream</em> has viewers trace the
                Arabic words for each chapter of the documentary, an ingenious strategy to draw viewers deeper into the
                story.

                        Ground</strong> showing the pamphlet that reveals the once-imagined future of Aylesbury
                    Estate.</span></figure>
            <p><em>Common Ground</em> focuses on the Aylesbury Estate, at one point the biggest social housing project
                in Europe, as it is being demolished. The documentary follows homeowners who shine a light on the
                troubled history of social housing in England as they continue fighting against the council trying to
                displace them. As we move through the different spaces of the estate, talking head segments and archival
                images are projected on the sides of buildings and, at other times, viewers are given tools to peer into
                Aylesbury’s once-imagined future or to learn about news coverage by flipping through a virtual
                newspaper.</p>
            <p>Both of these VR documentaries continue a trend I noticed in the VR “films” at FNC this year: namely,
                that of moving away from tools inherited from cinema (e.g.first-person points of view) and towards more
                nuanced encounters with space and the subjects that inhabit them. Considering <em>Common Ground</em> won
                the “Grand Prix Innovation” for best interactive or VR project and that <em>Another Dream</em>’s Tamara
                Shogaolu won the “Best XR Pitch Award” for her upcoming project <em>They Call Me Asylum Seeker</em>,
                things are looking bright for the continued development of VR as a medium with its own language distinct
                from films or games.</p>
            <h3 id="5317"><strong>Felix &amp; Paul Master Class: “Unlearning Cinematic Conventions”</strong></h3>
            <p>In addition to the VR works at FNC eXPlore, the central event was a master class from local VR studio
                Felix &amp; Paul, makers of such experiences as <em>Miyubi</em>, <em>The People’s House</em>, and
                <em>Travelling while Black</em>.
            </p>
            <p>The presentation featured the studio’s eponymous co-creators and creative directors Félix Lajeunesse and
                Paul Raphaël. The two took turns explaining their goal of reproducing what they felt was most immersive
                in cinema — namely, its ability to create an “experiential” feel. As the title “Unlearning Cinematic
                Conventions” implies, the two creators were wary of simply reproducing strategies inherited from cinema
                and instead focused on their early attempts with stereoscopic 3D and expanded cinema installations,
                which eventually led to experimenting with VR. Speaking from years of experience, Lajeunesse and Raphaël
                told us about their vision for cinematic VR, which spoke to the inclinations of this film festival
                audience.</p>

                    studio.</span></figure>
            <p>After the master class, I asked Lajeunesse about the problem of accessibility still faced by most VR
                works. He confirmed that VR projects will get most of their exposure from festivals such as FNC, but
                added that ensuring continued engagement requires additional efforts, such as touring a location-based
                version of the project. Ultimately, Lajeunesse described the need to move beyond the current platforms
                and hardware-dependent ecosystems to the more ubiquitous context of “spatial computing.”</p>
            <p>While Lajeunesse looks forward to this post-screen world where “all the content will move towards
                immersion,” where “content will be deployed to a platform that is immersive and interactive,” I can’t
                help but wonder about how this will influence the types of works being created. As expansive a platform
                for XR as this future might have for us, it will entail a new learning period and the creation of
                experiences that depart from the “cinematic VR” of today, which remains a product of the head-mounted
                displays that make it possible.</p>
