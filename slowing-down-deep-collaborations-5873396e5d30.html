                    response</a>: More adventures in making stories with and for the people</h3>
            <p>How do you take community engaged local production practices and build grassroots capacity to sustain
                that storytelling? This is a challenge that <a href="https://mediamobilizing.org">Media Mobilizing
                    Project</a> set out to face when we were founded as a community media hub in 2005.</p>
            <p>Reading Sue Schardt’s “<a
                    href="https://immerse.news/adventures-in-making-stories-with-and-for-the-people-a5559087d8ac">Adventures
                    in Making Stories With and for the People</a>” was a heartening look into how public media is
                tackling this challenge by transforming traditional journalism practices. I was excited to learn from
                examples produced for <a href="https://findingamerica.airmedia.org/">Finding America</a>, including in
                my own town, through <a href="http://whyy.org/cms/everyzip/">WHYY’s Every Zip Philadelphia</a>.</p>
            <p>My work at Media Mobilizing Project borrows from some of the same lessons, while making use of practices
                from community organizing, networked social movements, and social-impact documentary to put the internet
                and new media in the hands of working-class communities and social justice organizers. Drawing from
                those traditions, here are some additional takeaways for making stories with and for the people.</p>

                    Dinner</span></figure>
            <p>A lesson we share with the Finding America project is the practice of slowing down and taking time. In
                many ways not working in the format or structures of the breaking news cycle helps us push toward a
                deeper level of engagement. Many of our productions are short documentaries, introducing a social issue
                and the people engaged in tackling that issue through grassroots and community-based action.</p>
            <p>We’re not producing for news first, but storytelling for local community impact. I couldn’t agree more
                with all there is to gain by disconnecting from the “breakneck speed of the internet,” and taking the
                time to get to know the people we’re telling stories for and with.</p>
            <p>Our pieces at MMP are also mostly produced by small teams of volunteer and freelance contributors with a
                range of media and organizing skills. In this way, the production process also provides a learning
                process. Learning and exploring an issue is ripe with opportunities for relationship-building, and
                collaborating directly with the people and communities in our stories to better tell stories.</p>
            <p>For this to work, we’ve needed to incorporate production processes that are iterative, open, and
                exploratory. Starting to produce stories in new communities outside of our hometown of Philadelphia has
                been the greatest opportunity to test and refine this approach.</p>

            <p>Media Mobilizing Project is new to work in South Jersey, but because of the host of connections and
                networks that spread across the Delaware river from Philly, we’ve sought to tell stories that include
                this part of the region. Putting the subjects of the story in real leadership of the storytelling has
                been fundamental to us engaging this region that’s new to us. The result of this effort meant that when
                it came time to premiere our recent short documentary, <em><a
                        href="https://mediamobilizing.org/our-side/">Our Side: The Other Atlantic City</a></em> at the
                Garden State Film Festival, the figures in the film introduced and presented it to their own community.
            </p>
            <p>Their community and networks have served as the starting point for the story, serving as co-authors in
                its telling, and as connectors shaping some of the networks for the film’s distribution.</p>
            <p><em>Our Side</em> is a story about the power of knowing your history. The documentary is based on
                interviews with the actors, writers, and the director of a community-led theater adaptation of the book
                <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Other-Atlantic-City-Northside/dp/1450007546">Growing up in
                        the Other Atlantic City: Wash’s and the Northside</a></em> by Atlantic City native Turiya S.A.
                Raheem. We found our way to the story through our earlier work with union organizers slammed by casino
                closings such the Trump Taj Mahal, resulting in the video “<a
                    href="https://mediamobilizing.org/building-a-sandcastle/">Building a Sandcastle: A Broken Promise to
                    Atlantic City</a>.”
            </p>
            <p>While screening <em>Building a Sandcastle</em> and learning from residents how the city is portrayed, we
                became interested in how to tell the story of Atlantic City beyond the casino closings that define
                current news about the shoreside destination. In a media landscape that repeatedly paints Atlantic City
                residents as victims without much agency to affect the plans of state politicians and crony capitalists,
                we wanted to tell a story that acknowledges those oppressive systems, but still offers up a more
                resilient vision put forth by residents themselves—similar to media work of the <a

            <p>We met Turiya Raheem, and with her permission began sit-down conversations with cast members of the
                Spring 2016 production of her play. Turiya and the play’s director, Travis Love, became co-producers:
                identifying cast members to interview, setting up filming events in the community, and providing
                considerable feedback throughout the editing process.</p>
            <p>Raheem and Love worked collaboratively with MMP filmmakers T.C. Owens and Ellen Reynolds, who filmed and
                edited the film. As white filmmakers not from Atlantic City trying to tell a story about the African
                American community that has been exploited time and again in the city’s history, T.C. and Ellen took a
                lot of time to build trust with Turiya, Travis, and the cast members. This collaboration intentionally
                brought protagonists in the story into the documentary’s production and editing process.</p>
            <p>Now, turning to a period of community screenings and distribution, our goal is to screen <em>Our
                    Side</em> as a piece of inspiration within their networks. Travis, Turiya and others in the film
                have trusted us with their contacts and connections — and most importantly, their story — to share the
                film. These relationships will be a starting point to building new networks and relationships for our
                next production, and hopefully shifting the prevailing narrative and power dynamics of the city.</p>
            <p>There are challenges all along the way for media makers and community organizers tackling rights and
                justice issues through storytelling. Any community—but especially those who have dealt directly with
                inequality, racism, and injustice—are not going to easily trust outside storytellers. Histories of
                places are layered, and have many sides, so relationships to the community are necessary to ground and
                situate the history of the story.</p>
            <p>It’s been important for us to develop a training space and collaborative production process that supports
                those engaged in production, emphasizing not just the shine of the finished product but more importantly
                the art of collaborating. Media Mobilizing Project has systematized this practice for the stories we
                tell through our <a href="https://mediamobilizing.org/introducing-2017-fellows/">Movement Media
                    Fellows</a> program.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/533/1*fIDyTtUdA1TLv3FKTShlvw.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="1550350091094127891">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="1550350091094127891"><span class="marginnote">2017 Media
                    Mobilizing Project Movement Media Fellows</span></figure>
            <p>Now in its third cohort, the Movement Media Fellows is an intensive and hands-on learning experience. A
                core principle of the Fellows program is working in teams. Also key are the collaboration skills the
                teams develop through working with organizations, grassroots groups and community leaders.</p>
            <p>This production and training practice is summarized in an evolving curriculum tool we use called
                “Qualities of Movement Media Makers.” We borrow the “qualities of…” framework from other community
                organizers we’ve had the chance to collaborate with. The qualities sum up lessons hard won over the
                years from the successes and failures of our community produced media. For us, the process of making
                stories with and for the people is about cultivating and refining these qualities.</p>
            <p>A Movement Media Maker is…</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Connected and committed to people’s struggles</li>
                <li>Politically grounded and informed</li>
                <li>Accountable to building power collectively</li>
                <li>Technically skilled</li>
                <li>Able to craft winning narratives</li>
                <li>Lifts up community arts and culture</li>
                <li>Emotionally intelligent</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It’s this last quality — the emotional intelligence — that I would most urge every storyteller and media
                producer to embody. This means being okay with turning the camera off. The stories we tell thrive and
                grow through building relationships. Emotional intelligence takes that relationship-building process
                seriously. Without it our encounters and engagement with communities will be short-lived.</p>
            <p>So yes, here’s to making time and being okay with where the story may lead you. Producing a documentary
                about the play <em>Growing Up in the Other Atlantic City</em> was not what we were expecting as we began
                research. But it allowed us to go beyond surface issues and more importantly build foundational new
                relationships.</p>
            <p>We’re seeing these connections continue to come up, as now the community of Atlantic City reaches back to
                us to share stories of their struggles with police accountability and water access. <em>Our Side</em>
                was the start of a relationship, not the end.</p>
            <p>Schardt leaves us with the insightful reflection that journalists, news stations and storytellers have an
                important project ahead of them to expand and diversify the public media audience. Documentarians, media
                artists, cultural workers, and organizers — at the grassroots — can make some critical contributions to
                that project, and deepen the local work of amplifying and connecting the local leaders who improve our
                local spaces. It’s a necessary step in addressing the protracted issues of our nation.</p>
