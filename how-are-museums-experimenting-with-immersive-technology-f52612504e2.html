            <h2 id="2266">How Are Museums Experimenting with Immersive Technology?</h2>
            <h3 id="a4cd">A follow-up with Knight Foundation grantees</h3>
            <p>Last summer, in conjunction with a Knight Foundation call for ideas, <em>Immerse </em>ran a <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/arts-institutions-immersive-tech-3b197d51b0a4">series of articles</a> on
                how cultural institutions are engaging audiences through emerging media in creative ways. In the end,
                the foundation awarded nearly $750,000 total to five museums across the country. <a
                    href="https://knightfoundation.org/press/releases/shaping-the-future-of-technology-in-museums-knight-invests-750000-in-five-experiments-using-immersive-technology-in-the-arts/">The
                    winning projects </a>range from a virtual reality experience that connects audiences with women of
                the African diaspora, to the creation of new open-source software that transforms data into interactive
                experiences. A common thread among the projects is leveraging immersive technologies such as VR and AR
                to strengthen audience engagement.</p>
            <p>I spoke with leaders of four of the five projects several weeks before the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic
                in the United States—including those from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, the
                Museum of Art and Design at Miami Dade College, the Japanese American Museum of San Jose, and the
                Colored Girls Museum in Philadelphia. While all of the institutions are temporarily closed, they are
                continuing to move forward with their Knight projects on a delayed timeline.</p>

            <p>I chatted with Michael Walker, Manager of Media Relations at the American Museum of Natural History
                (AMNH) in NYC, about AMNH’s Knight-funded project over email.</p>
            <h3 id="9f8c"><strong>Can you tell me about the museum’s project?</strong></h3>
            <p>The Knight Foundation work is really about telling stories about the museum itself. And, for that, data
                visualization and interactive storytelling allow for exploration of the museum’s history in a compelling
                new way. The idea is to provide a very broad view of an institution’s history. Of course, we are
                focusing on AMNH, but the software we’re developing will be open source and we hope it will be adopted
                by other institutions. This can be achieved by using metadata from our scientific departments and
                library archives to visualize whole collections over time and space, illustrating when and from where
                objects have been acquired. That information can be contextualized in other historical narratives as
                well — what else was going on in the world or the country at that time? Then, we can add layers of more
                highly resolved information about individual objects or smaller collections to tell stories about how
                and why they were collected. We can use photogrammetry or CT-scan data to enable visitors to “handle”
                objects and to study them in detail.</p>
            <p>We are considering using parts of our cultural anthropology collections and related exhibition halls as a
                focus of our prototype.</p>
            <h3 id="e485"><strong>Why is it important for museums and cultural institutions to explore emergent
                    technology?</strong></h3>
            <p>There are two reasons. One is simply that the public is interested in it. They encounter it in other
                settings and enjoy novel experiences. We can leverage that interest to engage visitors with our content
                in exciting, new ways. It’s also a natural expression of an institution’s continued relevance to culture
                and society.</p>
            <p>The second reason is that digital technology is an essential part of modern scientific investigation. For
                instance, scientists use imaging technologies such as CT scanners to study biological specimens. These
                scans result in extremely detailed digital models that allow for close study of morphology without
                destroying specimens. These data are so important to their work that when I asked one of our scientists
                if we could refer to them as “digital artifacts,” he told me that they actually call them “digital
                specimens,” because they are as primary to their research as the physical specimens from which they are
                derived.</p>
            <p>In addition to data collection through observation (scanners, microscopes, telescopes, etc.), there are
                computer models and simulations that are essential to how researchers study processes in the natural
                world, from the evolution of the entire universe to climate change. And so, as a natural history museum,
                we need to engage visitors in these digital products in order to communicate how and what we know about
                the natural world. We do this on digital platforms. Emerging technologies that support more resolution
                and more interaction allow for direct communication of these large data sets. The same way AMNH created
                the modern diorama 100 years ago, we are thinking about how to exhibit digital representations of
                nature.</p>
            <h3 id="0ed1"><strong>What do you think the future of science visualization is?</strong></h3>
            <p>It’s the future of science itself! The data will get larger and larger, and so the visualizations will
                get more and more highly resolved, more and more naturalistic, and so more compelling to the general
                public. The graphics cards are getting faster so we’ll be able to create more immersive interactive
                experiences in which visitors can experience and explore our best understanding of how nature evolves
                and behaves. For science, visualization is an essential part of the process of exploration and
                interpretation. For the public, it’s a gateway to those discoveries.</p>
            <h2 id="fa80"><strong>Museum of Art and Design at Miami Dade College</strong></h2>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/450/0*hYkg5NHQrhH6ZV3o" width="800"><label

                        Architecture” exhibit at Museum of Art and Design (MOAD) at Miami Dade College</em></span>
            </figure>
            <p>Sophie Landres, Ph.D, is the Curator of Public Programs at the <a href="http://www.mdcmoad.org/">Museum
                    of Art and Design (MOAD) at Miami Dade College</a>, and curator of their Knight project and upcoming
                installation, <em>Through Forensic Architecture: True to Scale.</em></p>
            <h3 id="3fe8"><strong>Can you tell me about MOAD’s Knight project?</strong></h3>
            <p><em>Forensic Architecture: True to Scale</em> is an invitation for interdisciplinary partnerships
                committed to learning about — and through — the technologies that mediate our realities. Amidst what is
                increasingly referred to as our “post-truth” media environment, our programming draws from experts in
                the fields of architecture, journalism, data analyzation, platform development, and human rights to
                teach crucial skills for verifying evidence of state violence.</p>
            <p>As part of this exhibition, <em>True to Scale</em> debuts a new forensic architecture investigation,
                co-produced by MOAD. The work chronicles forensic architecture’s first use of virtual reality to assist,
                record, and represent witness testimony. Beyond supporting this specific project, the show serves as a
                generative prototype for future engagements with augmented reality. It is an opportunity for MOAD to
                develop the infrastructure needed to continue utilizing the didactic and aesthetic potential of
                immersive technology.</p>
            <h3 id="cb46"><strong>Why is it important for museums and cultural institutions to explore emergent
                    technology?</strong></h3>
            <p>Just as immersive technologies can play a prominent role in exhibiting information in an aesthetic,
                precise, and accessible manner, arts organizations can take the lead adapting technologies for the
                collective good. In adopting immersive technologies, museums and cultural institutions can explore these
                innovations from a critical lens: How should these technologies be used? How do you draw the line
                between spectacle and education? To what extent can these technologies harm or help the public good?
                Empowering museums with immersive tools for storytelling allows institutions to be thoughtful in their
                approach.</p>
            <h3 id="c1bb"><strong>Why are grants like this so important?</strong></h3>
            <p>From acquiring the technology, to training staff on its use, and creating specialized content for these
                specific platforms, immersive technology requires considerable investment—and arts institutions are
                notoriously underfunded. If immersive technology is going to emerge as a new tool among cultural
                institutions, organizations like the Knight Foundation will be pivotal as financial and educational
                partners. For example, MOAD’s leadership team was flown to Microsoft’s Seattle headquarters to learn
                more about their AR and VR tools and applications. The experience was invaluable because it prepared our
                team to resolve key questions and issues we might face when implementing the technology on our own.</p>

                        American Museum of San Jose</em></span></figure>
            <p>Tom Izu<strong>, </strong>the executive director of the California History Center Foundation and Audrey
                Edna Butcher Civil Liberties Education Initiative and is leading <em>Hidden Histories of San Jose
                    Japantown</em> at the <a href="https://www.jamsj.org/">Japanese American Museum of San Jose</a>
                (JAMsj)<em>. </em>This<em> </em>augmented reality project will enhance the museum’s connection to the
                surrounding community.</p>
            <h3 id="0279"><strong>Could you tell me a bit about the museum?</strong></h3>
            <p>JAMsj was founded about 32 years ago in the historical center of the San Jose area’s Japanese American
                community. The museum’s official mission is to collect, preserve, and share Japanese-American history,
                culture, and art with a focus on the Greater Bay Area. Its current strategic plan includes ideas of how
                to expand its scope to place Japanese-American history in a broader, multicultural narrative, and to use
                new technology to reach a younger demographic of potential museum members. It is a small organization
                with only one full-time director and is supported by a large number of community volunteers. It is the
                only museum in Japantown.</p>
            <h3 id="9c61"><strong>Can you tell me about JAMsj’s Knight-funded project?</strong></h3>
            <p>JAMsj has been searching for a way to expand its audience and volunteer base beyond the local
                Japanese-American community and to find new ways to reach a younger demographic. We believe an AR art
                project can do this by:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Going beyond our museum walls to capture the imagination of the growing number of visitors to
                    Japantown’s ethnic-related cultural and art activities;</li>
                <li>using AR and displays in our gallery to encourage our regular visitors to explore the surrounding
                    neighborhood to see new potential in what their local museum can do for the entire community, and
                </li>
                <li>using AR art as a way to reach out to the two communities left out of our standard narrative and who
                    share the history of our neighborhood: the Chinese and Filipino communities, both significant and
                    growing regional populations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="7245"><strong>Your project statement says that you’ll enhance the museum’s connections with the
                    surrounding community by leveraging augmented reality and art. How do you plan to do this?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>JAMsj’s grant team will organize, train, and support local artists, tech people, and college students to
                create nine new art installations using augmented reality technology that expose a layer of hidden
                history and little-known stories about the three communities and the common ground they share.</p>
            <p>The project will bring together representatives from JAMsj, the Chinese Historical and Cultural Project
                (CHCP), the Filipino American National Historical Society of Santa Clara Valley (FANHS), and their
                supporters to inspire the artists and designers of the project. To make future joint projects possible,
                we will deepen the ties between the three communities the organizations represent.</p>
            <p>JAMsj will engage students from San Jose State University, Santa Clara University, and De Anza Community
                College by further developing existing ties with digital design and Asian-American Studies faculty from
                those institutions. These youth, who may be art-, technology-, or history-oriented, will be teamed up
                with ethnic artists from their local communities and trained to utilize AR technology.</p>
            <h3 id="0131"><strong>Why is this project important?</strong></h3>
            <p>There is a sense of urgency to this work. While Japantown is experiencing an upsurge in interest from the
                general public, it remains quite vulnerable to the growing pressures of gentrification overtaking
                Downtown San Jose. This makes it all the more crucial to broaden our support and seek unity and common
                cause with the Chinese and Filipino Americans.</p>
            <h3 id="1f12"><strong>Why use AR specifically?</strong></h3>
            <p>AR allows us to use the physical space of the surrounding community as an exhibit space and makes it
                highly accessible to the public since they can use their own cell phones or hand-held devices rather
                than using special equipment. They can view the AR art pieces at any time.</p>
            <h3 id="5daa"><strong>What do you think is the future of emergent technology in museums?</strong></h3>
            <p>As emergent technology becomes more accessible to the public and affordable for institutions, it will
                expand the ability of smaller museums to “grow” exhibit and activities spaces by using VR/AR. Besides
                creating new virtual space within the museum, it can make the physical neighborhood area surrounding the
                facility become exhibit space.</p>
            <p>For museums to stay relevant to the public, they will need to position themselves to become the public
                space for learning how to use this new technology for social engagement and education.</p>

            <p>Vashti DuBois is the founder of <a href="http://www.thecoloredgirlsmuseum.com/">The Colored Girls
                    Museum</a> (TCGM) in Philadelphia, a multidisciplinary-memoir museum focused on “the ordinary
                colored girl.” This four-year-old institution is established and supported by a diverse collective of
                community members including artists, neighbors, friends, educators, and students.</p>
            <h3 id="0e3d"><strong>Could you tell me about The Colored Girls Museum’s Knight-funded project?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>TCGM and The Center for Digital Humanities at the University of Arizona (CDH) have teamed up to create a
                walk-through virtual reality museum. TCGM is an emergent art community where each exhibition is
                co-designed by two or more artists. Blended authorship and co-creation is foundational to our curatorial
                practice. We aim to extend this model to VR, where our community of Black female creatives will
                collaborate to imagine how their work will show up in virtual space.</p>
            <p><em>The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face</em> is an exhibition that features portraits of young women of
                the African diaspora aged 7–21. For this exhibition, portrait artists and subjects are asked to document
                their creation process/experience through journaling. We will work with this dynamic group of artists
                and models to build a world around the artworks and process journals. For instance, portraits may come
                to life and talk to the audience. By holding space for a communal process, the art will speak to the
                models and artists lived experience, vision and memory.</p>
            <p>Currently, there are over 10,000 original artifacts located at TCGM, in Philadelphia, PA. Normally, these
                artifacts are only available for visitors to the museum to view but rarely touch. The stories each of
                these objects hold is only accessible if museum staff or the artist is physically present to tell it.
                The introduction of AI/VR technology will provide both physical visitors to the museum, and virtual
                visitors, enhanced access to the narratives which inspired the creation of each artwork, thus enabling a
                profound and rich learning experience around our collection, our artists, the local community and
                African diasporic culture at large.</p>
            <h3 id="7ca7"><strong>Why explore VR and AR specifically?</strong></h3>
            <p>As a new museum intent on serving a historically overlooked audience, we recognize the enduring power a
                VR web museum will have in making our real-life space accessible to wide audiences online whose lives,
                stories, and images are traditionally excluded from American institutions.</p>
            <p>We intend to uplift hidden histories and lived experiences through technology. Our strategy includes a
                pre-production phase where we can ask ourselves and our community two fundamental questions: What should
                a (virtual) museum do? How can we use technology to build equitable communities which center
                historically marginalized voices?</p>
            <p>Museums and cultural institutions are being called upon to play a much more active role in communities —
                to reach beyond the comfort of display cases to relate to the concerns of ordinary citizens, diverse
                communities, and to create varied opportunities for education and engagement. New technologies remove
                many of the barriers that keep some people out of this institution.</p>
            <h3 id="67e1"><strong>Why is it important for museums and cultural institutions to explore emerging
                    technology?</strong></h3>
            <p>TCGM creates for our audiences an immersive environment in which “Black girlhood” is the primary
                experience. VR technology allows us to extend that. VR can position the patron as an “an actor,” not
                just a bystander. The patron can walk in a Black girl’s shoes. AR allows us to imagine multiple ways
                that guests might interact/engage with our exhibits and objects. It allows us to overlay information in
                different ways — provide sensory entry points, for example, and make digital experiences adaptive and
                interactive.</p>
            <h3 id="88e8"><strong>Why are grants like this so important?</strong></h3>
            <p>TCGM is a small museum and we like that. Our size allows us to be responsive to the communities we serve.
                What can a museum do ? A museum can be an advocate, it can be a safe space for people and ideas.</p>
            <p>A grant from a funder like the Knight Foundation for immersive technology investigation and
                experimentation is a game-changer because it allows us to have a bigger footprint and broader impact
                without having to become a “bigger” institution with all the challenges that come with that.
                Additionally, this kind of grantmaking enables us to attract critical partners like Bryan Carter and his
                team at Arizona University. Our partnership activates new learning and brings folks into this new
                technology conversation who typically might not have a seat at the table.</p>
            <p>We work with artists. We work with Black girls and women. We work as a collective. Therefore we know that
                what we create together in the field will be fundamentally different — and new. Without opportunities
                like this, TCGM might still be “imagining” what we <em>could </em>do with technology if we had the
                resources — who we could reach. Now we have an opportunity to reach those folks. We have an opportunity
                to do and not dream. The technology is expensive — it changes quickly and it is so important to be able
                to get your foot in the door. Small institutions and grassroots projects need this more than anyone. It
                gives us a chance to really focus on our missions connecting and serving people.</p>
