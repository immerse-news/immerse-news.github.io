                    Reunions Project (FRP) is an initiative exploring how technology can challenge borders and reshape
                    the way we think of immigrants’ transnational lives.</span></figure>
            <p>I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of film, tech, and migration. And, being undocumented, my
                experience with technology has always been different than most.</p>
            <p>I remember the first few times my family Skyped back home to Guatemala. It was a thrilling experience to
                be able to see my mom look at my grandma’s face on the computer, no longer having to pay for
                long-distance calling cards to only have a few minutes to talk. We were lucky that my grandparents had
                internet, our own virtual connection.</p>
            <p>“Let me see the house,” my mom would ask.</p>
            <p>She missed home, but we couldn’t go back — not with our immigration status. So the calling cards and
                Skype continued, the only accessible thing to us that could defy borders.</p>
            <p>I had been creating short films and videos for some time and became inspired to explore VR after sneaking
                my way into the Interactive day at the Tribeca Film Festival. Knowing my passion for media and
                storytelling, our friends at the New York State Youth Leadership Council (<a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/nysylc/">NYSYLC</a>), an undocumented youth-led organization,
                connected me to Alvaro Morales, the co-founder of what would become the Families Reunion Project (<a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/FamilyReunionsProject/">FRP</a>). We both shared an interest in VR
                and had immigration on our mind.</p>
            <p><em>What if we “transport” families back home using VR and 360 video?</em> Alvaro proposed.</p>
            <p>His idea instantly made me think of my mother. I asked my parents if they would like to be the first
                family to try it out. In a matter of days, my mother found a video producer with a 360 camera in
                Guatemala to film the first “VR Postcard.” We call them “VR postcards” because they were pre-recorded
                messages that are sent across borders. Using some of my savings, we recorded, edited and produced our
                first “virtual reunion”</p>

                    that are pre-recorded in home countries and then shown to families here in the US. The process is
                    straightforward but also labor intensive.</span></figure>
            <p>The first reunion instantly showed us just how powerful this medium could be.</p>
            <p>My mother was able to see the house we left behind. She was able to see her old school, her friends, and
                her grandfather and his house, a place she wasn’t allowed to visit as a child.</p>
            <p>My father instantly felt transported to the street where he used to hang out. His friends greeted him
                extending their hands towards the camera and my father extended the gesture back.</p>
            <p>The experiences were emotional to say the least. I asked my parents afterwards how they felt; my dad,
                maybe hiding emotions, said that he felt happy and with more strength to continue the fight.</p>
            <p>My mother, on the other hand, said that she wanted to go back.</p>

                    you)</span></figure>
            <h3 id="bfa8"><strong>Obstacles and opportunities</strong></h3>
            <p>When Alvaro and I first talked, we didn’t have any funding. Neither of us owned any equipment for this
                kind of project, and we were both unable to leave the U.S. In retrospect, we faced many of the same
                issues around accessibility that Ingrid notes in her piece, and at least for me, a few others as well.
            </p>
            <p>I could have benefited from finishing college. Even though I went for a year, I had to drop out to work
                full-time in support of my family. My lack of access to learning spaces and opportunities to practice
                and improve my writing skills became noticeable when I had to write grant applications, briefs, bios,
                artist statements, and even emails.</p>
            <p>My financial situation prevented me from taking risks such as working on a visual project full-time, and
                my fear of deportation didn’t help either. These factors even affected my involvement in the very
                project I co-founded.</p>
            <p>However, in some ways, I have also had significant access to tools by living in New York City. My
                relationship with TFI’s <a href="https://tribecafilminstitute.org/programs/students">youth programs</a>
                and my high school education from the <a href="http://www.actvf.org/Welcome.html">Academy for Careers in
                    TV and Film</a> exposed me to people, skills, and knowledge that have been integral in my personal
                and professional development.</p>
            <p>Outside of institutions, it’s been my friends who have helped me write, navigate application processes,
                or even just share advice. It’s been my community that has snuck me into spaces (like Blue Ridge Labs
                and TFI’s Interactive day) and has been committed to pushing for my presence there.</p>
            <p>It was our community of friends, family, and supporters who helped us create FRP.</p>
            <p>Around the same time of my family’s virtual reunion, we got some good news. <a
                    href="http://www.e4fc.org/">E4FC</a>, an organization that provides incredible support to
                undocumented people, created a grant specifically for undocumented entrepreneurs, and we were one of six
                to receive it. The grant is essential in ensuring marginalized people (in this case undocumented) have
                opportunities to kickstart their ideas.</p>
            <p>Our past connections and networks became the friends who helped us out during our production, friends who
                volunteered their time to help stitch, shoot, and edit with us. Even family members that had no prior
                experience in media became great producers as we created the postcards.</p>
            <p>The NYSYLC supported FRP by using their network of members to help find families for the reunions. In
                some cases, their space even became our place of “virtual reunions.”</p>
            <p>Truthfully, our community showed up in the best way they could.</p>

                    Chalco, Mexico visiting the street where he grew up.</span></figure>
            <h3 id="bfc7">Centering communities</h3>
            <p>I don’t know how to solve the systemic problems around accessibility. I can talk about redistributing
                funding within the art world and rethinking programs and applications that continue to uphold white
                supremacy, but I just got here…and I just entered this conversation. I think the first step involves
                bringing more people from communities affected by oppressive systems into conversations.</p>
            <p>Organizations such as <a href="http://culturestrike.org/">Culturestrike</a> are focusing their events on
                bringing together “cultural gatekeepers to translate intentions of solidarity into institutional
                practice.” This means creating spaces where artists from migrant, queer communities, and gatekeepers
                discuss inequities in the art world.</p>
            <p>TFI did the same last week during its inclusion council. The council, led by <a
                    href="https://www.alliedmedia.org/dna">Detroit Narrative Agency</a>, discussed different practices
                and models around gender and racial equity. We talked about generating programming from within the
                community rather than leaving it to outsiders.</p>
            <p>These models of conversations, where we center the communities we are hoping to bring into the space, are
                essential to replicate. The people who have been fighting for access are the ones who should speak on
                behalf of the change they want to see. By doing this, we uplift and acknowledge the power of each
                community.</p>

                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="11395893375428382807"><span class="marginnote">After
                    Alvaro’s massive undertaking, the FRP has taken on over 12 virtual reunions. A few of these reunions
                    were filmed by the families themselves using small 360 video kits we provided.</span></figure>
            <p>I’ve seen the impact of community support and meaningful conversations with the FRP.</p>
            <p>Soon after E4FC’s initial funding, the FRP received further funding from TFI and CultureStrike. The
                collection of these grants allowed us to continue working on the project — meaning we would have enough
                money to travel, edit, buy equipment and, most importantly, continue to create more experiences for
                families.</p>
            <p>As we push the boundaries and uses of new mediums, I keep thinking back to my family and my mom. I’m
                happy that we got the chance to play with the medium, and fortunate that my mother was able to
                experience something that transcended borders.</p>
            <p>Maybe VR is for me to imagine, maybe it’s for my mom to relive, maybe it’s for healing, for memories, for
                ourselves. We may never know what VR is for unless we continue to bring new voices into the field.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I’m thankful for all the work and support our communities have put in for the project and our vision.
                    Our community of friends knew long-term investment went a long way.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I wanted to give a few thanks to the people who helped us along the way: Maria Fernanda Andia, for
                    helping me write and edit this response. To NYSYLC, Lupe, Diana, Angy, who got us together and saw
                    the potential. To Sonia, Favianna, and the team from CultureStrike. Our friends at E4FC, the Tribeca
                    Film Institute, FIRME, who continue to do amazing work. DNA, who I met last week, for facilitating
                    such a great conversation.</p>
