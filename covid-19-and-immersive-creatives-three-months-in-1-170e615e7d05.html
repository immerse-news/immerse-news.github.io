                    Covid-19 on Immersive Creatives</a><em>,” an article I wrote nearly 100 years ago, way back in
                    March, I’ve continued to talk to artists about their pandemic experiences. With three months under
                    our belts, we are used to social distancing and stay-at-home orders (almost). Wearing a mask outside
                    no longer phases us. And, we’ve started to see a “new normal” emerge in our personal and
                    professional lives as we continue to shelter in place.</em></p>

            <p>When the pandemic broke out, Raqi Syed and Areito Echevarria were in the final stages of launching their
                virtual reality project, <em><a href="https://minimum-mass.com/">MINIMUM MASS</a></em>, about a couple
                who experience a series of miscarriages and come to believe their children are being born in another
                dimension. <em>MINIMUM MASS</em> is a 20-minute experience that takes place in a real-time,
                photorealistic computer-generated story world; it has been developed for the Oculus Rift-S.</p>
            <p>At the time, they had just received their third-party, motion-capture facial data and were getting ready
                to do the final binaural sound mix. They had been working with a Los Angeles-based composer.</p>
            <p>“These things are difficult to do remotely because of all the lag,” says [which one?] “We have remote
                desktop access to our studio, but we can’t physically be in there. We’ve got less than 10%, maybe 5%,
                left to go on the project before it’s complete, but we just haven’t been able to push through.”</p>
            <p>Tribeca Film Festival Immersive launched the 360 VR component of <em>MINIMUM MASS </em>as part of its
                online Virtual Arcade, but the interactive pieces could not be released online. Tribeca did host an
                online marketplace for creators, which allowed the pair to meet people and talk through the projects and
                the future:</p>
            <p><em>“The Americans and the Europeans have very different ideas about how we are going to emerge after
                    Covid.” [says which one?]</em>The Americans have specific fears regarding physical contact with the
                VR headsets, while the Europeans don’t have so much resistance:</p>
            <p><em>“I think a lot of it has to do with how space is understood in different places. In America, we’ve
                    always had more space…” says </em>Syed.</p>
            <p>Because they’re based in New Zealand, they face additional challenges“<em>It looks like the border is
                    going to remain closed for the foreseeable future. So even if everyone is able to return to daily
                    normal life, nobody will be able to leave, or enter, the country,” </em>says Echevarria. This makes
                attending festivals impossible. What does a festival premiere look like when the directors are not
                physically present?</p>
            <p><em>We are working on an experimental documentary about empathy, which has been long-listed for IDFA in
                    Amsterdam. But is there a point in premiering it at IDFA if we can’t go and meet people?”
                </em>Echevarria asks.</p>
            <p>So far, they have been able to weather the economic turmoil.</p>
            <p>“I think we are in a relatively fortunate state so far,” says Syed. “We are academics and our research,
                which is our creative practice, is partially funded through the University.”</p>
            <p>However, it’s unclear how long this will last. <em>“It’s somewhat ironic because we left the film
                    industry to become academics because it was a more stable career option, but… there’s been talk
                    about redundancies, pay-cuts, and this kind of thing, so it’s very uncertain,” reflects</em><strong>
                </strong>Echevarria.</p>
