            <p><a href="https://docubase.mit.edu/">Docubase</a> is a database of the people, projects, and technologies
                transforming documentary in the digital age, curated by the MIT Open Documentary Lab. It is a place of
                discovery where you can immerse yourself in various playlists and projects, unearth new work, explore
                techniques, and find people who are pioneering storytelling forms. Docubase opens up the digital
                storytelling process by providing production data about each project, behind-the-scenes materials,
                interviews, and case studies to demystify the process and encourage participation.​ The public is
                invited to participate and learn from this growing community of digital documentary makers: comment,
                suggest a project or a tag, write a playlist.​</p>
