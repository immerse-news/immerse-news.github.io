            <h3 id="0b9a">Lizzie Warren and Michaela French discuss immersive documentary and ecological emergency</h3>
            <p>In a parallel world, documentary maker Lizzie Warren and artist Michaela French heard each other speak at
                the <a href="http://i-docs.org/">i-Docs</a> Symposium in March 2020 in Bristol, UK. They had coffee
                together in one of the breaks and discovered a range of shared professional interests around creative
                media practice and environmental issues.</p>
            <p>But, of course, in <em>this</em> world, i-Docs was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and neither
                Lizzie nor Michaela was able to present their talk, which had been scheduled in the “climate and
                ecological emergency” strand of the symposium.</p>
            <p>At i-Docs, we’re now exploring what a rescheduled version of the March symposium might look like — a
                series of remote events, for instance, or some combination of live and remote, depending on the whats
                and wherefores of a global pandemic. The work of creatively thinking our way through an ecological
                emergency, though, is ever-relevant and pressing, and so together with <em>Immerse</em> we convened
                virtual conversations between four of our programmed speakers — Lizzie and Michaela, and a second pair,
                digital design researcher Bronwin Patrickson and visual journalist Tom White. Read on for Lizzie and
                Michaela’s conversation, and Bronwin and Tom’s conversation will appear in the next issue of
                <em>Immerse</em>.

            <p><strong>Michaela French</strong>: The project I was planning to present at i-Docs was a short 360°
                fulldome documentary called <em><a href="https://docubase.mit.edu/project/climate-crimes/">Climate
                        Crimes</a></em> which explores the complex relationship between global air pollution, climate
                change and human migration. Global warming acts as a catalyst for social conflict and uncertainty on a
                local level, which in turn also has a global impact. The film was commissioned for <em>The Future Starts
                    Here</em> exhibition at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, and was developed and created in
                collaboration with architect Dr Adrian Lahoud and fulldome animator Max Crow.</p>
            <p>I see the connection between our films in terms of a systems perspective. Mine is micro and global and
                yours reflects the reality of that at ground level (quite literally). I like that interrelation.</p>
            <p><strong>Lizzie Warren</strong>: Yes. I was thinking along the same lines. Can you tell me a little bit
                about why you chose the format you did? It strikes me as unique.</p>
            <p><strong>French</strong>: I’ve been working in planetariums on and off for a long time. In 2014, I started
                the Fulldome Research Group at Royal College of Art in London. It was a collaborative project with the
                planetarium at Royal Museum Greenwich to explore the creative potential of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulldome">fulldome</a> space. The collaboration with Adrian
                Lahoud came out of that project. Adrian had made a preliminary HD video about his research but wanted to
                see what it would do to the story if we told it in dome space instead. The collaboration ran for about
                two years with various iterations of the film being exhibited and it ended with the version you saw as
                an installation at the V&amp;A’ s <em>The Future Starts Here</em> exhibition. Right now I’m converting
                my dome master to 360 video, my first move into VR territory.</p>
            <p><strong>Warren</strong>:<strong> </strong>Cool. I love immersive works related to the built environment —
                like panoramic paintings and cyclorama.</p>
            <p><strong>French</strong>: I think the boundaries are not defined in immersive space in the same way as
                cinema because it’s emerging but also because the space is harder to define…</p>
            <p>Tell me about your film.</p>

                    Sam (M1784) by Lizzie Warren with the Google Jump</span></figure>
            <p><strong>Warren</strong>: The project I was going to present at i-Docs is a seven-minute 360 video that
                immerses viewers inside a pack of critically endangered red wolves housed under a Species Survival Plan
                (SSP) at the Wolf Conservation Center in New York. This particular family, consisting of two parents and
                four yearlings, make up a significant percentage of the red wolves left on earth. I originally wanted to
                make a more traditional documentary about a sanctuary that takes in wolves that have been illegally kept
                as pets. Sometimes the owners know they’re getting a wolf and sometimes they are shocked when the puppy
                grows up. And the interplay between the wolves and their human caretakers is very intimate. In the US,
                each state has its own rules about what percentage of “wolf DNA” a dog can have or whether one can
                simply keep a wolf as a pet. There’s this gray area.</p>
            <p>The opportunity came up, though a Google program, for me to use this incredible VR camera and put it into
                a red wolf enclosure. The red wolves are kind of the opposite of the more domesticated wolves — they
                haven’t been exposed to humans in their entire lives. It seemed like a great opportunity to see them up
                close. Because the camera was so big and heavy we were able to put it in the enclosure without the fear
                that they would try to destroy it (although they did bite the tripod’s rubber feet).</p>
            <p>Red wolves are the most endangered in the world. The genetics of the red wolves are highly scrutinized
                and managed. The entire existing population comes from<a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/07/red-wolf-endangered-species"> just
                    fourteen wild wolves</a> that were left after the species collapsed about thirty years ago.</p>
            <p><strong>French</strong>: It’s interesting that your focus shifted based on the tech available to you,
                that it allowed a different story to be told.</p>
            <p>What response have you had to the film? I get a strong impression that you are committed to impacting the
                population numbers by sharing the story.</p>
            <p><strong>Warren</strong>: Yes. The question was always, “How can we film the wolves without negatively
                impacting them or introducing more people into their environment?” The caretaker of the red wolves
                thought this would be good stimulation for them, to interact with something new in their environment.

            <p>One more note about 360: One thing that came out was how the wolves communicate spatially. They move as a
                unit. That’s something that you can’t really experience in a flat format. But when you’re in the 360
                format, you can see and kind of feel them moving around you in a way that feels so natural. That was the
                kind of amazing thing for me.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>One thing that came out was how the wolves communicate spatially. That’s something that you can’t
                    really experience in a flat format.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>French</strong>: The issue of spatiality is interesting. In terms of the way we view immersive
                content, I really like that the medium allows a new or different perspective on real-world dynamics.</p>
            <p><strong>Warren</strong>: How will your project change as you move it into a 360 format? Do you imagine
                people’s experience with it will change? Will your goals around it change — or is it more of a
                continuation?</p>
            <p><strong>French</strong>: I think making it into 360 video will change the experience for sure. First, I’m
                concerned people won’t be able to read the text and graphics, but the scale and the shared experience of
                the planetarium are really integral to how we wanted to tell the story. So, I’m not sure how 360 will go
                but am happy to open to a much broader audience.</p>
            <p><strong>Warren</strong>: Did you think about genre when you made this? That is a kind of wrinkle in the
                360/VR production space.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/1068/1*zAD9s8DLtT9jDOQhz7yW0A.png"

            </figure>
            <p><strong>French</strong>: The Fulldome Research Group remit was in part to expand the language of fulldome
                space using practice-based research, so we were intentionally looking beyond the standard fulldome
                genres, which are either science education, space and astronomy, or digital moving geometry for rave
                culture immersive music experiences.</p>
            <p>Environment, climate change, and social issues were not commonly discussed in planetariums. There are
                lots of reasons for this but we felt it was important to start telling stories that reflect the real
                world rather than dreams of conquering space.</p>
            <blockquote>

                    conquering space.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Warren</strong>: I think there is a boundary, largely unspoken, that technology is supposed to be
                the “star” of newer format works. The advocacy pieces have to operate in a very prescribed way or
                they’re kind of off-piste. But maybe that’s all media and art. I don’t know… I showed the Red Wolf piece
                at SeriesFest, which is a big TV festival in Denver. There were people watching it who didn’t have a lot
                of VR experience and they seemed to really love how slow it was. I think tech people are a little more
                like, “Why didn’t you cut this faster??” But you have to give yourself over to the vulnerability of
                being in the headset when not a lot is happening, and that can feel awkward if you’re not expecting it.
            </p>
            <p><strong>French</strong>: Learning to go slow is a big part of the Covid-19 lockdown for me and it’s not
                always comfortable! But it’s so good and so necessary, so I say it’s great that you went off-piste, made
                a choice that is challenging but gentle at the same time. A key aspect of my Ph.D. thesis is the concept
                of “an education of attention.” Making time to observe and experience, we learn differently — and I’d
                say we are often more attuned to the real world over the intensely mediated one we spend our lives in.
            </p>

            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Warren</strong>: I can’t seem to get away from trying to integrate that slowness or friction-y
                movement into my work, including my most recent project. It’s about community-created media from the
                1960s.</p>
            <p>In a funny way, when everyone started to self-isolate I thought, <strong>now</strong> people would want
                to watch the wolves for fifteen minutes. Does that sound insensitive? I think our current social
                restrictions have changed the calculus of what people are looking for or have time for or need from a
                piece of immersive media.</p>

            <p><strong>French</strong>: Do your films often have an environmental perspective?</p>
            <p><strong>Warren</strong>: Not really. I’m interested in it but not particularly well-versed . . . although
                now I suppose we all are thinking about it constantly. Or, at least, I feel like I’m broadening my
                particular interest, which tends to center around people’s interaction with bureaucracy or more
                specifically the intersection of trauma and bureaucracy, to include ecological concerns. I don’t feel
                very nimble in articulating those issues, though. Do you?</p>
            <p><strong>French</strong>: No, not specifically. But <em>Climates Crimes</em> has changed things for me
                and, combined with my Ph.D., my direction has definitely shifted toward an ecological and systems
                perspective.</p>

            </figure>
            <p><strong>Warren</strong>: How did <em>Climate Crimes</em> change things for you?</p>
            <p><strong>French</strong>: Making the film coincided with reading a lot of theory about ecological and
                systems perspectives: Bateson, Daina Meadows, and, specifically, James J. Gibson’s <em>The Ecological
                    Approach to Visual Perception</em>. I found I couldn’t hold onto old patterns of thinking and
                experience as knowledge became a new foundation.</p>
            <p>In making the film, and for the immersive space of the dome, I felt it was important to try to
                communicate these concepts visually, and experientially. To do that required somehow embodying the
                understanding of permeability, responsibility, and inseparability. If I really wanted my audience to
                understand it I felt I needed to feel it deeply. There was no going back. There are a few images of the
                floating bodies of refugees in the ocean from coastguard archives. I found myself in a strange
                relationship with these people, not knowing them or whether they were alive or dead, but building
                empathy with a plight that I found deeply moving and humbling. I wanted to represent each of them with
                respect as individuals. It felt like quite a load to carry, I had some responsibility to tell their
                stories.</p>
            <p><strong>Warren</strong>: So, did your thesis grow out of that research?</p>
            <p><strong>French</strong>: They went back and forth together, running alongside each other for about 3
                years. The Ph.D. research also became quite a personal journey as well. But I guess that’s the nature of
                the artistic practice, all these threads combine and inform the creative process.</p>
            <p><strong>Warren</strong>: I think we covered some ground. I really enjoyed your piece and our
                conversation!</p>
            <p><strong>French</strong>: I completely agree, it’s been a pleasure meeting you.</p>
