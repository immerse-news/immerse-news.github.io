                        Mediography</a></em><em> is an interactive database of virtual reality nonfiction content
                    covering the period 2012–2018. Our database charts the emergence of VR nonfiction on a timeline,
                    placing the release of content within the wider context of international film festivals and key
                    milestones of VR technology development. In this article, we talk about the process of identifying
                    and cataloguing this content before highlighting some key findings from the first six years of VR
                    nonfiction.</em></p>
            <p>Since 2012, producers of VR nonfiction have created diverse works encompassing a variety of forms, from
                linear 360° video to interactive room-scale CGI experiences. Other works have gone further still, mixing
                elaborate real-world sets, human actors, and multi-sensory apparatuses to create installation-based
                pieces that blur the boundaries between cinema, games, and immersive theatre.</p>
            <p>Over the last 24 months, the <a href="http://vrdocumentaryencounters.co.uk/">Virtual Reality: Immersive
                    Documentary Encounters</a> project has been systematically identifying and collating VR nonfiction
                content to create a<em> mediography</em> — an online interactive timeline charting the history of work
                in the medium.</p>
            <p>Beginning with Nonny de la Peña’s groundbreaking 2012 piece “Hunger in LA,” our collection now numbers
                over 530 titles. With the ultimate aim of creating a comprehensive record of titles in English, we have
                cast our net wide — scouring the programmes of over 70 international film and documentary festivals
                alongside extensive organic search, social media, and the catalogues of a range of content aggregators
                including WITHIN, Jaunt, and <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>
            <p>The metadata we are collecting is also providing us with new insights into how producers are exploiting
                the affordances of the medium. In 2018, we presented the first research output from the mediography
                project in Glasgow at the <a href="https://chi2019.acm.org/">International Conference on Human Factors
                    in Computing Systems</a>, the leading conference on Human-Computer Interaction. In our paper <em><a
                        href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3300736">Behind the Curtain of the “Ultimate Empathy
                        Machine”: On the Composition of Virtual Reality Nonfiction Experiences</a></em>, we performed a
                deep-dive examination of 150 VR nonfiction titles, identifying 64 characteristics of the medium
                including aspects of visual/audio composition, viewer role, and interaction.</p>
            <p>VR nonfiction content typically presents as one of two forms: live-action 360° video and
                computer-generated (CGI) pieces that are typically created using a game development engine such as
                Unity. Although there are increasing levels of overlap, the differences in skill-set, personnel, and
                workflow across these two production methods remain considerable. At least for the time being, it is
                useful to consider them separately.</p>
            <p>Our deep-dive analysis has also revealed key differences between these two forms. For instance, we found
                that 360° video-based content tends towards a model of assigning the viewer the role of passive
                observer, more often than not adopting an objective omniscient viewpoint. This appears contrary to its
                early promise to allow viewers to “‘stand in the shoes of others.” On the other hand, CGI based VR
                nonfiction, while exploring a broader range of viewpoints and viewer roles, lacked interactivity to a
                level that surprised us: only 8% of CGI-based titles provided for active participatory involvement in
                the story beyond movement of the head.</p>
            <h3 id="f632"><strong>How has VR nonfiction developed so far, and where is it heading?</strong></h3>
            <p>Our dataset of 530+ titles reveals that 70% (380 titles) of VR nonfiction content released between 2012
                and the end of 2018 were entirely — or predominantly — linear 360° video (i.e. non-interactive beyond
                head tracking, with small amounts of CGI content in cutscenes and titling accepted). The remaining 30%
                (160 titles) consisted of CGI-based titles with varying degrees of interactivity.</p>
            <p>To understand how these two types of content have developed over time, in <em>fig. 1</em> below we show
                the number of releases for each type of content over the 2012–2018 period against the number of new
                content directors entering the market.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/600/371/1*SR7P2z1l9EQLO-IzgMcIWg.png"

                    title and new entrant director counts for 360° video and CGI-based VR nonfiction, 2012–2018.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>We draw attention to two points of interest in this data. The first is that, following a sustained period
                of rapid year-on-year growth, 2018 saw the first signs of a downturn in raw content numbers <em>and</em>
                new-entrant directors for both types of media. While we must first stress that our content collection
                for 2018 is not yet as thorough as it is for previous years, we also note that increasingly fewer new
                titles are emerging from our recent searches. We, therefore, anticipate the final picture to indicate a
                leveling-off for CGI and a slight decline in 360° video.</p>
            <p>The second point of interest is that, following a spike in new directors of 360° video content entering
                the market in 2016, this number dropped sharply in 2018. Across the full dataset, we have identified 430
                unique directors of VR nonfiction content. However, looking at their output over time, we see that the
                vast majority of these directors — 81% — have only released one piece of work. Despite the rapid influx
                of new content in the first six years, it is striking that the number of directors in VR nonfiction that
                have since gone on to direct three or more pieces is just 38 (9%).</p>
            <p>A similar picture emerges when we examine VR nonfiction in our film festival data. In <em>fig. 2
                </em>below, we plot the number of<em> </em>VR nonfiction titles that were released for each year and
                shown at international film festivals, again splitting across linear 360° video and CGI-based works
                (titles that are shown at multiple festivals in the same year are only counted once). In this case, we
                do have extensive data for 2018 and have also included data for 2019 based on the programmes of 10
                leading international festivals for VR nonfiction content in that year.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Here we can again see the spike in 360° video content on the 2017 film festival circuit. Here, however,
                the spike is even more pronounced, and is followed by a similarly dramatic cooling in 2018/19. For the
                first time since 2015, 2019’s festival output appears to be fairly evenly split across the two forms.
            </p>
            <p>To understand what went on in the film festivals of 2017 and what this might mean for the future of these
                two forms of VR nonfiction, the mediography reveals several key events from the preceding two years. The
                first is that, since the premiere of <em>Hunger in LA</em> at Sundance 2012 (widely accepted as the
                first showing of a VR nonfiction piece at an international film festival), multiple international film
                festivals had been quietly starting to pick up VR nonfiction content on their programmes. By this point,
                new CGI-based content was slowly beginning to emerge from creatives working with the “developer kit”
                model of the Oculus Rift and also from others experimenting with 360° video-based experiences. By 2015,
                Sundance showed six pieces of VR nonfiction. Two appeared at Tribeca, three at Sheffield Doc/Fest, and
                seven were shown at IDFA.</p>
            <p>A second key event in 2015 was the release of <em>Clouds Over Sidra</em>. This nine-minute 360° video
                piece — a story of displacement in the then-raging civil war in Syria — went on to generate considerable
                <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/31/virtual-reality-movies-aid-humanitarian-assistance-united-nations">international
                    press attention</a>, with particular focus given to how VR seemed able to create a heightened sense
                of empathy between audience and subject. Chris Milk, the creator of <em>Clouds Over Sidra</em>, would
                later describe VR as the “<a
                    href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_milk_how_virtual_reality_can_create_the_ultimate_empathy_machine?language=en">ultimate

                    first installment of our </a><em>Immerse</em><a

                    article series</a> by my colleague Harry Farmer.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout 2015, interest in VR quickly spread among the filmmaking community. Creatives who wished to
                explore 360° video production were further supported by the arrival of specialist 360° cameras such as
                Nokia’s “OZO,” significantly reducing technical barriers and costs to entry. Release numbers for VR
                nonfiction titles rapidly increased, jumping from just nine in 2014 to 43 in 2015, with the number of
                new content directors also increasing by 300% from 10 to 40. By November of that year, <em>The New York
                    Times</em> had released its own VR nonfiction content platform NYT VR, <a
                    href="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/the-nyts-new-project-will-be-vrs-first-mainstream-moment/">supplying
                    free Google Cardboard headsets to over one million of its subscribers</a>.</p>
            <p>By 2016, following TechCrunch’s prediction that <a
                    href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/08/virtual-reality-ready-to-take-flight-in-2016/">2016 will be
                    the year of VR</a>, the consumer model of the Oculus Rift launched, with HTC releasing its
                room-scale Vive platform one month later. In May, Oculus responded directly to the growth in VR
                nonfiction content by launching <a href="https://www.oculus.com/vr-for-good">VR for Good</a> — a
                programme providing funds and mentorship to content creators interested in exploring the pro-social
                potential of VR. By the end of the year, the release of VR nonfiction titles had tripled, from 43 to 136
                — an expansion particularly marked in the number of 360° video-based releases. New directors entering
                the scene also tripled, from 40 to 119.</p>
            <p>By 2017 then, all of the stars were aligned. In that year, we saw VR nonfiction content production
                reaching a peak, with multiple film festivals showing record numbers of VR nonfiction content. However,
                when we come to examine the <em>type </em>of content being shown, it is clear that there was a heavy
                emphasis on 360° video over CGI. This distinction is important. While the overall numbers of 360°
                video-based titles has only declined slightly in the years since 2017, the number of these titles being
                picked up and shown at film festivals appears to have dropped dramatically.</p>
            <h3 id="ed67"><strong>So what does this tell us about the future of VR nonfiction?</strong></h3>
            <p>A straightforward conclusion to draw is that 360° video-based VR nonfiction has passed through a bubble
                of rapid early-adopter interest and is now beginning a period of rationalisation. CGI-based nonfiction
                content, on the other hand, has displayed a slower but fairly consistent growth, and — if the healthy
                and diverse showing at this year’s Venice Biennale is any indicator — may well be the main source of
                growth for the medium over the next few years.</p>
            <p>However, as <a href="https://immerse.news/building-it-as-we-go-226f24086e86">Ingrid Kopp has discussed in
                    a previous issue of </a><em><a
                        href="https://immerse.news/building-it-as-we-go-226f24086e86">Immerse</a></em>, the way in which
                VR nonfiction is distributed and exhibited in the coming years will be key to what happens next for both
                forms. While VR content now appears to be well established at film festivals, we are now beginning to
                see more augmented and mixed reality-based nonfiction content vying for audience attention — often
                sharing the same programmes.</p>
            <p>Further, the immediate future of the in-home VR nonfiction market remains far from clear. It is notable,
                for example, that several key players from 2014–2018 have now wound down or pivoted their attention to
                other forms of XR. Notably, <em>Jaunt </em>— one of the earliest adopters of 360° video — switched its
                attention to focus on augmented reality-based content in October 2018, and in the UK, early adopters
                such as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50080594">the BBC have now wound down its VR
                    production</a>.</p>
            <p>This may seem rather downbeat, but we must be mindful that such activity is not entirely unexpected;
                early enthusiasm for any new medium tends to give ground as the longer-term underlying challenges become
                more salient.</p>
            <p>Whether VR nonfiction surpasses the heady heights of 2017 remains to be seen, yet the rapid pace of
                innovation in VR, particularly in live-scene volumetric capture, provides ample opportunity to suggest
                that the best of the medium remains ahead of it, not behind. Nonny de la Peña’s innovative <a
                    href="https://www.reach.love/">Reach</a> platform, for example, promises CGI-based content
                generation and distribution in a single centralised package that will hopefully reduce many of the
                barriers to entry that have dogged the CGI side of VR in its early years. Indeed, who would be better
                placed to guide the next stage of VR nonfiction development than its pioneer?</p>
            <h3 id="9079"><strong>What’s next for the Mediography project?</strong></h3>
            <p>As an ongoing piece of work, we want the VR Mediography project to be a useful tool for both researchers
                and practitioners in VR nonfiction. In the short term, we will be working to complete our collection and
                encourage readers to contact us about any content we might have missed. Similarly, we are continually
