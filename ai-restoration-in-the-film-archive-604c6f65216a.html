            <h3 id="0284">Uprezzing the classics — and “generating” new ones?</h3>
            <p>In February 2020, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8J_xbbBuGobmw_N5ga3MA">Denis
                    Shiryaev</a> uploaded a new version of Lumière Brother’s iconic 1896 film, <em>The Arrival of a
                    Train</em>. Shiryaev modified the film using AI tools: the video was “uprezzed” to 4K resolution,
                making the images sharper; new frames were generated, making the movements smoother; the images were
                colorized and the film grain was removed. Described as “AI-restoration” all these new modifications made
                one of the first films in the history of cinema look more like the contemporary videos we encounter
                every day. The video was watched by millions and brought new life to the trend of uprezzing and
                colorizing archival films.</p>

                    (1896), courtesy of Société Lumière</span></figure>
            <p>Since then, Shiryaev has uploaded many more videos, from Louis Le Prince’s mysterious film <em>Roundhay
                    Garden Scene</em> (1888) to city travelogs from the early 1900s. These videos in total have garnered
                almost 65 million views and Shiryaev has gathered close to 600k followers.</p>
            <p>In November 2020, The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/05/magazine/snowball-video-fight.html">New
                    York Times published an article</a> by Sam Anderson, reflecting on another “AI-restored” Lumière
                film, <em>The Snowball Fight </em>(1897): “On an intellectual level, we all understand that historical
                people were basically just like us… and yet it’s hard, across such wide gulfs of time, to really feel
                this connection. So to watch this snowball fight, to see these people so <em>alive</em>, is a precious
                gift of perspective.” Anderson’s words voice the novel, facile connection to the past that thousands of
                viewers probably feel when watching these videos.</p>
            <p>However, these two videos are not available online anymore. AI-restored versions of <em>The Arrival of a
                    Train</em> and <em>The Snowball Fight </em>are taken down due to copyright claims. In March 2021,
                Shiryaev received a dispute letter from Institute Lumière (IL), the representative of the Lumière
                estate. In the letter Shiryaev shared, the IL informs him that the copyright of the film is still
                protected. Their claim: since Auguste Lumière died in 1954 and that copyright is protected for 70 years
                since the death of the last author, this film will not be public domain until 2024.
                <strong>Surprisingly, the first films ever shot are still protected under copyright law.</strong> The
                length of protection afforded by copyright law in the U.S. has been periodically extended, as major
                intellectual properties (such as Mickey Mouse) have approached entrance to the public domain, and their
                copyright owners have successfully lobbied for these extensions. In France, the length of protection was
                similarly extended from 50 to 70 years with changes to the law in the ’90s.
            </p>
            <p>IL also claims this work is an infringement on the authors’ “moral rights,” a copyright law that is
                active in France and several other countries. The “moral rights” are perpetual and prohibit any
                alterations that are not intended by the author. Thus, IL argues colorizing and changing the frame rate
                is at odds with what the creators intended. Shiryaev explains IL’s process as an attempt to “copyright
                the history,” and as he was in a financially insecure position, he didn’t want to risk fighting back.
            </p>
            <p>But what is the proper way to preserve and present the past? How should institutions and archivists think
                of AI tools in relation to restoration, copyright and “moral rights?” For this, I talked to Elif
                Rongen-Kaynakçi, the silent film curator of the <a href="https://www.eyefilm.nl/en">Eye Film Museum</a>
                in the Netherlands, known for its work in film restoration and is one of the biggest archival film
                collections.</p>
            <p>With excitement, Rongen-Kaynakçi commented that many people in the archival film community has been
                discussing copyright issues lately. (For example, <a
                    href="https://domitor.org/conference/2022-culpeper-conference/">the 2022 Conference hosted by
                    Domitor, an influential society dedicated to the study of early cinema</a>, focused solely on
                copyright this year.) Rongen-Kaynakçi says that many YouTubers, including Shiryaev, use films from the
                Eye Collection and uprez and colorize them using AI. For example a video on Eye Film Museum’s YouTube
                channel might attract 6000 views, while the same video, modified by AI, might draw 6 million views on
                another channel. Eye’s approach is a little different than Institute Lumière’s. They see these YouTube
                channels as an entry point for millions of people, many of whom may never have heard of them, into their
                work. They want the videos to be seen, but they also want the labor of the institution to be
                acknowledged.</p>
            <p>Rongen-Kaynakçi brings up a complicated hypothetical scenario: What if, for example, a TV channel wants
                to broadcast the AI-restored/colorized version of the silent films? Where would they get the video from
                and who would they license it from?</p>
            <p>Rongen-Kaynakçi pointed to the work of Dr. Claudy Op den Kamp, who is doing invaluable research regarding
                copyright in moving images. <a href="https://youtu.be/kH39kTV4ONA">In a recent talk</a>, she mentions
                that there is a large shift in technology in the post-internet era: it used to be harder to reach the
                source material and easier to control film distribution. Today, films circulate much faster and without
                effort. Copying is very easy, thus the legality is muddy and complicated. She mentioned that when using
                archival materials that are preserved by institutions, “the process is not exclusively legal.” It is
                dictated by the rules of the archive and is a negotiation between different parties. <strong>Copyright
                    is not only a legal issue, it is an ethical and institutional issue as well.</strong></p>
            <p>And there is another question: could the work of Shiryaev be considered restoration? Eye Museum’s Chief
                Curator Giovanna Fosatti <a href="https://youtu.be/VErhutC5-aA">defines film restoration</a> as “actions
                undertaken to bring the film back to a form that is as close as possible to its original form.” But
                problems arise when we try to define what the original form is. It can be “textual”, such as the plot,
                intertitles and credits of the film. Or “material”, the original colors of the film, the original medium
                (35mm, 16mm…). <strong>The usual restoration processes attempt to bring the film </strong><em>back to an
                    original form</em><strong> through these two categories. From this perspective, “AI-restoration” is
                    less of a restoration but more of a creative modification.</strong></p>
            <p>But then there might be a more speculative category, let’s call it “situational” — contextualization of
                the film as perceived by the audience of a new era. Can AI-restoration be about this “situational”
                aspect? As Anderson’s article suggests, these films provide a new bridge to the past. Since they look
                similar to the images we look at on our phones and computers, we react with surprise: the past also
                looked just like the present. This type of restoration might be recreating the <em>perception</em> of
                the time. When audience members watched <em>The Arrival of a Train</em> in 1896, the images appeared to
                them as cutting-edge and totally new. When we watch an AI-restored version of the same film today, we
                again share a similar surprise. <strong>This is the tension between what is emotionally authentic versus
                    materially authentic.</strong></p>
            <p>As the questions around archives and copyright are being renegotiated, a new angle is also appearing in
                the background. What do we do with archival images in the time of AI image creation? As I have been
                writing this article, Dall-E and similar projects have become extremely popular. I had a chance to
                access Midjourney, a platform similar to Dall-E. and asked the platform to create images with the prompt
                “Lumière Brothers, The Arrival of a Train”. Here are the images the AI produced:</p>

            <p>These images don’t look like the original film, however they have the feel of it. <strong>These images
                    wouldn’t be the same if the films of Lumière Brothers weren’t online and accessible to AI
                    algorithms. Nor would they exist without the vast archive of images used to train the algorithm. So
                    then, what are these images? Are these original? Are they subject to copyright?</strong> These novel
                issues can provide new angles for bigger questions: How should the past be preserved, owned and
                presented?</p>
