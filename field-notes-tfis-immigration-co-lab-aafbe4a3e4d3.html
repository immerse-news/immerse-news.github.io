            <p>In December, the <a href="https://www.tfiny.org/">Tribeca Film Institute</a> wrapped up its Immigration
                Co/Lab with a beautiful showcase that left many in the audience in tears. Let’s take a look at the
                journey that got us there.</p>
            <p>The Co/Lab (collaboration and community) is a new program funded by the Time Warner Foundation that
                provides local communities with the knowledge and resources needed to construct their own stories. The
                first edition in 2016 focused on Detroit. This year, we brought the Co/Lab home to NYC and made a point
                to join the burning national conversation on immigration.</p>
            <p>Over the past few years, we have seen a significant rise in new media, interactive media, and tech-based
                media. But while issues of immigration have been addressed through the lens of these new and emerging
                practices, oftentimes the creators and the intended audience do not identify with the experience of
                migration and relocation. By emphasizing community-based empowerment — stories told by the community for
                the community — the Immigration Co/Lab aimed to flip that narrative.</p>
            <p>We kickstarted the lab with a conversation about immigration from different points of view. Mary Madden
                moderated the conversation, and she was joined by immigration attorney Talia Peleg, who spoke about the
                state of immigration through the lens of some of the case studies she has worked on; Mohammad Khan, the
                campaign director for <a href="https://mpowerchange.org/">MPower Change</a>, spoke about grassroots
                activation and how to collectively stand together against injustice. Artist/activist <a
                    href="http://marisajahn.com/">Marisa Jahn</a> spoke about deploying design thinking and new media
                tools to tackle social issues, while Radhika Subramniam — the Director/Chief Curator of the Sheila C.
                Johnson Design Center at The New School — spoke about the ways animal migration shapes human migration.
                Finally, Leslie Martinez, who was also a participant in the lab, spoke about the evolution and impact of
                <a href="https://www.hacktheban.org/">Hack the Ban</a>.
            </p>
            <p>The lab started on Thursday and ran for three days, from 9:00 am until 10:00 pm. There were five teams,
                each with six participants, who included recording artists, journalists, storytellers, filmmakers,
                designers, technologists, and educators divided into different teams based on their interests. They
                worked nonstop in this high intensity, high-stress, collaborative environment. They pushed through
                challenges and worked through fires to create some spectacular prototypes for projects.</p>
            <p>Below you can read the teams’ statements about the project prototypes. We had a few onsite mentors —<a
                    href="http://mohinidutta.com/"> Mohini Dutta</a>, <a href="http://bennorskov.com/">Ben Norskov</a>,
                <a href="http://haithamennasr.com/">Haitham Ennasr</a> — who joined us for the duration of lab and
                helped us push the teams to the finish line. Jahn and <a href="http://gianordoli.com/">Gabriel
                    Gianordoli</a> also joined us on one of the days to share their expertise. The collective energy and
                kindness in the space was very palpable and it all really shined through during the Interactive
                Showcase.

            <p>This speculative web marketplace would be used as a tool not only to create things, but to share
                narratives. We are using product design to materialize the real human stories behind what being a
                constantly surveilled immigrant means. These products are not solving a problem, but their concept is
                thought to disturb how surveillance has been normalized in today’s society. COYOTEK is an alternate
                narrative, a slightly extreme version of our reality born to bring a more human approach to the effects
                of surveillance on immigrants nowadays.</p>

            <p>26 Federal Plaza. For years immigrants passed through these doors for regular check-in appointments with
                immigration agents to avoid deportation. Everything changed when President Trump took office. Check-ins
                are now ground zero for a new era of deportation. To enter or not? To enter may mean never walking back
                out, to skip means becoming a fugitive. Two million immigrants across the country must make this
                agonizing decision. Uncertain Trap makes a largely invisible crisis visible by inviting New Yorkers to
                use augmented reality to explore the collected stories of immigrants cruelly arrested during their
                check-ins at the physical location of 26 Federal Plaza. The interactive event asks participants to
                partake in a collective action of interrogation of the state and show solidarity with our surveilled,
                incarcerated, and deported community members.</p>

            <p>These five projects stem from personal experiences that tied many of the participants together. At the
                end of the lab, one of the participants spoke about how during this lab it felt like we were all on the
                same team — and that in of itself was a powerful occurrence. The organizers — myself, and <a
                    href="http://www.roulagholmieh.com/">Roula Gholmieh</a> — the panelists, the teams, and the mentors
                all identified with the experience of immigration in its multiple dimensions.</p>

            <p>Earlier in 2017, we hosted an Inclusion Council where we invited funders, peer organizations, and
                creators to have honest conversations about gender and racial equity. The biggest takeaway for us was
                that we wanted to create programs that are successful models of what is possible in terms of change. We
                focused our takeaways on this lab, and towards the end when the projects presented and people in the
                audience were in tears, we knew that something special had happened.</p>
