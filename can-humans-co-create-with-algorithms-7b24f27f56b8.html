            <p><em>One of the most provocative chapters of the Collective Wisdom report is titled “</em><a
                    href="https://wip.pubpub.org/pub/collective-wisdom-part-6">Media Co-Creation with Non-human
                    Systems</a><em>.” Authors Katerina Cizek and William Uricchio examine the possibilities and current
                    practices of creators working with both living systems such as swarms of insects and machine-based
                    systems such as artificial intelligence. Here are a few highlights:</em></p>
            <p>Co-creation between human beings and non-human systems is a sticky matter, often moving into the
                speculative realm. Artists and provocateurs have nuanced relationships to the systems they work with.
                Not all of these artists subscribe fully to a co-creative model, but most of those we spoke with
                acknowledge the idea of co-creation. Their vision, methods, and <em>raison d’être</em> align with so
                many of the methodologies apparent in other forms of co-creation, which we define as working within
                communities and across disciplines.</p>
            <p>At its best, co-creation allows artists and media makers to explore the hubris of humans positioning
                themselves as the planet’s only sentient beings. Such practices offer a hands-on heuristic to explore
                the expressive capacities and possible forms of agency in systems that have already been marked as
                candidates for some form of consciousness. Only by probing those possibilities will we be able to move
                beyond blanket assertions or denials of agency, and critically interrogate ourselves in the context of
                other possible forms of intelligence.</p>
            <p>Comparisons between animals, machines, and humans are nothing new. René Descartes, a foundational figure
                in 17th-century Enlightenment thinking, compared animals to automata. He asserted that only humans were
                capable of rational thought and operated as conscious agents, while animals simply followed the
                instructions hardwired into their organs. Only at the end of the 19th century did a more nuanced view
                slowly begin to take root, as Charles Darwin’s notion of mental continuity across species found
                adherents.</p>
            <p>Indigenous scholar and new-media artist Jason Lewis and his collaborators, write <a
                    href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/lewis-arista-pechawis-kite">in an MIT-published essay</a>
                that Indigenous epistemologies are “much better at respectfully accommodating the ‘non-human.’ ” He
                cites Blackfoot philosopher Leroy Little Bear to suggest that artificial intelligence may be considered
                on this spectrum, too: “The human brain is a station on the radio dial; parked in one spot, it is deaf
                to all the other stations … the animals, rocks, trees, simultaneously broadcasting across the whole
                spectrum of sentience.”</p>
            <p>Over his long career as an artist and professor in computational art, Ernest Edmonds has revisited the
                question of whether computers can replace artists many times, always ending at a negative answer. We
                asked him if the relationship might be better described as co-creative, and he rejected this model too.
                “Art is a human activity for human purpose, for human consumption, consideration, and enrichment. And
                the making of the art is as much a human process as the consumption of it. And so, I would say that if
                machines could make art for machines, that would be fine. But it would not necessarily have any
                relevance whatsoever to human beings.”</p>
            <p>Like Edmonds, Joseph Ayerle (a new generation artist and photographer), rejects co-creation as a way to
                describe his work with AI. He is the first artist to use “deep fake” technology in a short film, using
                off-the-shelf AI to map a face from 2D photographs onto 3D-modeled representations of other peoples’
                bodies. “I was at the beginning a little suspicious. I worked on a separate PC, not connected with the
                internet,” he told us via email, “But bottom line: It is just a tool.” He wrote to us that AI may
                “create, but it is not creative.”</p>
            <p>In music, David Cope was one of the first to explore the potential of AI, which he turned to when he
                suffered a case of writer’s block in 1980. He built Experiments in Musical Intelligence (which he calls
                “Emmy”), an AI which mimicked and replicated classical music styles, mostly of dead composers. In our
                interview he told us he did not describe his relationship with the now-retired Emmy as particularly
                co-creative, but he would say so of his work with another AI, Emmy’s “daughter,” which he calls Emily
                Howell. He describes their interaction as conversations: “That is, I work with her and she suggests
                things… I tell her what kind of things I want to compose or write or do or whatever, and she has a
                database just like EMI does, and the material in that, for her, musically, is all of her mother’s
                music.”</p>
            <p>Anthropomorphizing AI systems is a playful co-creative model adopted by other artists as well, especially
                those interacting with robots. New York-based artist Fei Liu built herself a robot boyfriend she calls
                Gabriel, and has loaded him with large collections of text messages from an ex-boyfriend. She performs
                with the robot, fueled by an AI system that takes existing text and creates new sentences. She says for
                now Gabriel is “ex-dominated,” but eventually that will change. “In terms of his internal systems, it’s
                like he has preferences. He has likes and dislikes. And then [his mood] is affected by, this is
                something I’m playing around with … a variable in the code, which is called the ‘self-love variable.”
            </p>
            <p>Much of the important work in AI projects reveals the limitations and dangers of relying too much on
                these systems, exposing the potential new cultural and political landscapes they could create if they
                remain unchecked, unregulated, and publicly misunderstood. Most of the co-creators we engaged with aim
                to turn these systems towards alleviating inequity and injustice at a digital and planetary scale.</p>
