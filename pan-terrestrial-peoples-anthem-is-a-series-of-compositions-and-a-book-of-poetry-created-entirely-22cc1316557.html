            <p><em>Pan-terrestrial People’s Anthem</em> is a series of compositions and a book of poetry created
                entirely from remixing the songs and lyrics of 195 national anthems. The music is constructed from
                sampling fragments of all anthems to build up an assemblage of sonic layers that transcend established
                geopolitical boundaries. The poems are created using computer programs that parse, filter, and
                reassemble the database of lyrics finding thematic and linguistic patterns in the 27,523 words.</p>

            <p>I’ve been fascinated with national anthems and how words and music are enlisted to strengthen bonds
                between people and ideas of national identity. I started to wonder if words and music could be employed
                to loosen bonds between people and their nations. Can text and sound be used to encourage people to see
                the nation-state as a relatively modern invention, not something that is a fixed given, but historically
                contingent and constantly in flux? Is there a way to focus on the interconnectedness of our actual
                existence instead of the separate-ness that many nationalistic movements (‘America First’) are leaning
                towards? Should we go back to city-states? Is there a new way to think about borders and spaces? In
                short, I feel the concept of the nation-state has caused so much suffering it should really be
                reconsidered in our current time.</p>

            <p>How can you emphasize interconnectedness and lack of fixity? In creating the 10 songs that make up the
                album <em>Pan-terrestrial People’s Anthem </em>the music slices small fragments of individual
                instruments, melodic lines, and chords from 195 national anthems and reassembles parts from different
                songs together. The idea is to build up an assemblage of sonic layers that transcend established
                geopolitical boundaries. In thinking about sonic metaphors to embrace a lack of fixity, or shifting
                borders, in sound I turned to new sonic possibilities afforded by the soundtracks of VR films.</p>
            <p>VR movies uploaded to Youtube can feature first-order Ambisonics that allow for the mix to shift and
                change based on the user’s head — or mobile phone — movement. I wanted to take advantage of this
                capability in my audio compositions to emphasize a feeling of fluidness and lack of fixity. Four of the
                ten compositions for this project are released as Youtube VR videos with Ambisonics soundtracks. All of
                them were created as 8 or 4 channel compositions and mixed to Ambisonics audio.</p>
