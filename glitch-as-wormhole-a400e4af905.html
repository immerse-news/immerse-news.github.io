            <p><em>PHI — a Montréal-based organization consisting of three separate but complementary entities, the PHI
                    Centre, the PHI Foundation for Contemporary Art and the PHI Studio — is guest editing the 37th issue
                    of </em>Immerse<em>. We continue the series, </em>Emergence<em>, with this third article written by
                    nènè myriam konaté and Lucas LaRochelle, curators of the PHI_portal. Through these articles, we will
                    explore how our approach has been shaped by new modes of art consumption, both online and offline,
                    how we responded, what we’ve learned, and what has fundamentally changed during the global
                    pandemic.</em></p>
            <p>Earlier this year, a conspicuous, inflatable gold box took up residence at the PHI Centre, located in the
                Old Port of Tiohtià:ke/Mooniyang/Montréal, the first site of French settlement on the unceded lands and
                waters of the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation. This structure, dubbed the portal, comes from Shared_Studios, an
                organization based in Lenapehoking/Brooklyn, on the unceded lands of the Lenni Lenape. Their portals
                form a transnational public art initiative connecting communities from 50 cities — from Ede Wageningen
                to Erbil to Bamako. Using immersive live-stream technology, the portals set an intimate stage for the
                public to connect with someone present on the other side of the life-sized screen.</p>
            <p>The PHI Centre invited us as curators to root the PHI_portal in the specificities of our city through
                co-creating programming with local artists, cultural practitioners, and technologists. Thus far, this
                co-creative process has taken the shape of activations that harmonize artistic exchange and emergent
                media, and their significance within our lived realities. The experience of entering the PHI_portal is
                akin to walking one’s full body through the internet. Embedded in a network of varying geopolitical
                realities, the portals facilitate the emergence of a third space — a hybrid zone where specific contexts
                can converge.</p>

                    class="marginnote"><em>Originally, Shared_Studios envisioned the portals as a powerful tool to
                        create conversations, collaborations, and connection. In the age of hyper connectivity, PHI has
                        been exploring new ways to redirect intention back to the creation of the transmedia experiences
                        we so often consume. Reimagining our physical and digital experiences was at the forefront of
                        the PHI_portal. On the left: XLoww, m</em>usic producer and singer/songwriter inside the
                    PHI_portal. <em>(PHI)</em></span></figure>
            <p>In dialogue with our sibling sites, we co-create the programming of the PHI_portal with and for our
                communities, inviting guests into an intimate space of possibility — through conversations,
                performances, listening sessions, readings and shared meals. Within this transnational curatorial
                network, distance is a force to move with, rather than against. The linguistic, geopolitical, and
                cultural specificities of each portal entangle us in a web of borders as we attempt to negotiate
                differences. In this flow, we are seeking to be seen in the homes/skins we inhabit, and to believe they
                might coexist with the ones we’ve been pulled towards and away from. If the portal is a mouth, the
                curators are the tongue(s), the language(s), the organ(s) that animate the connective tissue of our
                network, facilitating the emergence of ephemeral communions. As we find ourselves in a global health
                crisis and seek to articulate languages of healing and care, we are reminded that translation is not
                always necessary, that we can sit with the discomfort of misunderstanding and resist the urge to
                interpret that which is not ours to articulate.</p>

                    Shared_Studios, we invited the curators of 18 portals to collaborate during the first crisis of
                    COVID-19 in a collective short film. Discovering their documented environments with all available
                    digital cameras, we are invited to go to the other side of the portal through personal testimonials
                    and performances. (PHI)</span></figure>
            <p><strong>Access Denied</strong></p>
            <p>In March of 2020, after having only begun our relationship with the portal network, COVID-19 interrupted
                our access to the physical space of the PHI_portal. In the weeks that followed the shut down, we
                continued to communicate with curators via Zoom. Our initial connections, which had been marked by a
                sense of institutional urgency to produce programming, shifted towards the slow and necessary work of
                developing meaningful relationships.</p>
            <p>Situated outside of the copy-paste interiors of the portals, Zoom calls between curators ruptured a space
                of ubiquitous access and imagined neutrality by folding us deeper into the emotional and material
                realities that inform each voice. COVID-19 appeared as a glitch in the mechanisms of Empire — the new
                political order of globalization as described by political theorists Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri —
                which codes the architecture of our geopolitical context as an infinity of entries and uninterrupted
                movement. This glitch created a temporary wormhole that allowed us to imagine other modes of being in
                relation with one another, of shifting institutional priorities away from production and towards care.

                        receptacle of a cross-border dialogues punctuated by candid, heart-to-heart discussions and
                        artistic exchanges between creative and cultural communities. (PHI)</em></span></figure>
            <p>As we emerged from isolation in July and were able to reanimate the physical space of the PHI_portal, we
                were far more attuned to the sense of community we’d created with the curatorial network. The gold box
                became captivating because of its possibility to act as a public archive of the ephemeral intimacies
                generated by those who move through it. From this heightened sensitivity, it became clear that the
                <em>people</em> are the portal.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Transformative Intimacies</strong></p>
            <p>We must build infrastructures for empathy without the scaffolding of similarity, leaning into our
                divergent experiences as precisely that which connect us. This perspective, grounded in our experience
                of curating during crisis, drives our continued engagement with the possibilities of the PHI_portal in
                the face of sustained uncertainty.</p>
            <p>We are writing this article as Tiohtià:ke/Mooniyang/Montréal enters a second lockdown, and the PHI_portal
                shifts from a public-facing art initiative to an intimate space for cross-border encounters between
                artists and collectives. In this renewed experience of confinement, we can create without the pressures
                of the public gaze, returning our focus to the relationship-building that initially compelled us to join
                the portal network. Our emphasis is on being felt, more so than being seen.</p>
            <p>The portals might best be described as a place of longing — longing for a sense of intimacy with someone
                we might never meet again. We sew connections not because we expect a return on investment from the
                relationships built in a singular conversation, but because we long to care for someone other than
                ourselves simply because they are present. Central to this sense of longing is a flickering hope that
                these intimacies, born in the immediacy of the encounter, can transform us. In a dialogue on the social
                and political valences of <em>Hope and Hopelessness</em>, queer-of-colour performance scholar José
                Esteban Muñoz reminds us that “often experimental intimacies falter. But those failures and efforts to
                fail have a certain value despite their ends.”</p>
            <p>Failure, as many of us have come to learn, is an ordinary occurrence as we attempt to (re)build our
                personal and professional lives through videoconference technologies. Zoom meetings expire, Google
                Hangouts drop, internet access cuts or fails to reach all corners of our homes. The moment in which the
                digital connection fails is precisely the moment in which we are resituated in our fundamental
                difference — that we are not in fact in the same room and that our contexts shape and define us. This
                confrontation with distance and difference bleeds into the ecstasies of the moment of re-connection; an
                animation that pulls us to re-sew our attachments to one another.</p>
            <p>These glitches in what might be naively considered a “neutral space” are thus the foundations to build
                meaningful relationships that ground us with the power of being-together-in-difference. The moments in
                which we falter serve as evidence of our continuous attempts to grow in relation to each other. These
                are traces of the worlds we’ve reached for and might someday manifest.</p>
