            <h3 id="7bac">The rise of haptic storytelling</h3>
            <p>After the explosion, I hear voices calling for help.</p>
            <p>I feel my way forward, hand over hand, touching a pile of tires, a rusty barrel, a doorframe, kicking the
                rubble that demarcates the barricade behind which I’ve watched a peaceful street scene descend into
                panic.</p>
            <p>Stepping through the doorframe, I reel back, throat in mouth, as I find myself edging along a jagged
                precipice. Intellectually, I know I’m on solid ground, inside a building, no danger of falling. Still, I
                sidle along with the rough wall as my guide, heading for the voices: a man and a girl. I reach through
                what looks like a gap in the rubble, encountering a pipe the man begs me to shift—and then a warm, real
                human arm.</p>
            <p>It’s too much. I rip off the VR headset and briefly find myself surrounded by concerned faces. They put
                the headset back on and lead me out of the experience, to a hallway bench, where I dab tears and catch
                my ragged breath.</p>

            <p>The <em>HERO</em> installation is designed to expose untested civilians to how they might respond during
                a wartime crisis. Will they step up to help, freeze, hang back? At Sundance’s New Frontier exhibition,
                participants relinquish their nametags at the door, exchanging them for a role card that they feel best
                expresses their sense of self. <a
                    href="http://variety.com/2018/legit/news/frank-oz-sundance-twitter-feud-in-and-of-itself-1202682261/">This
                    approach mirrors</a> one that director Frank Oz and magician Derek DelGaudio utilized for Off
                Broadway show <em>In &amp; Of Itself</em>. My card says, “I am a partner.” As I leave, my name badge is
                returned to me with a small strip of cloth resembling camouflage tied to it — both a tactile reminder
                and a symbol to others who have gone through it.</p>
            <p>Still a bit shaken, I sit down with Vassiliki Khonsari, the co-founder of <a
                    href="http://inkstories.com/">iNK Stories</a>, which produced the experience in partnership with <a
                    href="https://www.starbreeze.com/">Starbreeze Studios</a>. The cards serve as a priming device, she
                explains, to help shape participants’ mindsets. For example, my impulse was to help—but people who
                choose the “I am an observer” card might hang back. This helps to make each person’s experience a bit
                different.</p>
            <p>“Once people walk into the <em>HERO</em> space we wanted them to strip themselves of all of the
                identifiers they’re associated with,” Khonsari says. “We want that to set the tone for how you enter the
                experience and become receptive to this moment in time. And after you have the experience it offers you
                the opportunity to reflect on yourself.”</p>
            <p>In addition to the StarVR headset, which offers a wide field of view, <em>HERO </em>is enhanced by a
                haptic backpack that transmits vibrations from the explosion, real-feeling props that mirror the objects
                shown in the street scene, and ambient sounds rather than those piped through earphones. The combination
                of analog and digital inputs is unnervingly convincing—the producers call it “Vérite VR.”</p>
            <p>“We were fortunate to push on technology, on artistry, on theatrics,” she says. “We wanted to see what VR
                is capable of, what mixed reality is capable of. We’re bringing together technologies that aren’t used
                together.”</p>
            <p>This variety and level of sensory input is unusual and expensive — but suggests how powerful the sense of
                touch can be in making an immersive experience seem real.</p>

            <p>What another demo in the same exhibition lacked in tactile immediacy, it made up for in gee whiz factor.
            </p>
            <p>Billed as a “cinematic VR platform,” the <a href="http://www.gopositron.com/voyager/">Voyager</a> chair
                moves a full 360 degrees and pitches 35 degrees both forward and backward. It also offers haptic
                feedback and spatial audio.</p>
            <p>I strap in to experience <em>Space Explorers,</em> directed by Felix &amp; Paul Studios. The chair allows
                the viewer to be embedded in a variety of scenes where astronauts are training for the harsh conditions
                of space travel: side-by-side with the driver of a rover through a snowy tundra, in the cockpit of a
                tiny plane, floating in a swimming pool next to trainees manipulating massive equipment in conditions
                that mirror zero-G.</p>
            <p>Beautifully filmed, and full of aspirational interviews about humanity’s future in space, the piece is
                tweaked for maximum awe. I find that the chair requires some suspension of disbelief, which I
                momentarily achieve during the experience of underwater weightlessness.</p>

            <p>A bit dazed from all this—plus an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccWWFsOtH3Q">earlier room-size
                    VR installation</a> that had me dancing with a mix of virtual giants, lilliputians, and actual
                humans represented by digital avatars—I wander through driving snow to the next exhibit space. The real
                world feels unreal, I explain to my faraway husband through my earbuds. I feel the chilly flakes landing
                on my face, the slush beneath my boot treads, but for a moment it seems distant, manufactured.</p>
            <p>Snow shaken off, I wander around the next venue and settle down at a table, where I’m prompted to put my
                hand palm up into a rubber tube connected to a metal box, topped by a screen. Created by a company
                called <a href="https://haptx.com/technology/">HaptX</a>, the device is designed to transmit not just
                touch, but sensations of hot and cold. Using a wand, I direct a spider to prance around, and then a tiny
                deer to stomp on my palm. A few moments later, a virtual dragon fries it to a crisp, and I’m tempted to
                pull away and shake my hand as heat washes over it.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/533/1*K3gq5YGenZqfoE-CTkdcFw.png"

                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>“Touch is a very visceral sense,” says Jake Rubin, HaptX CEO and founder. “So if you’re trying to tell a
                story being able to touch or drag something can bring more emotional engagement or more realism.”</p>
            <p>He explains that the effect is achieved through a “smart textile,” infused with channels and air pockets
                that change shape to create various sensations. Piping hot or cold fluids through conveys temperature
                shifts. Like pixels, the points of contact need to be smaller to create a higher-resolution tactile
                experience.</p>
            <p>HaptX is not currently geared towards a consumer market—the company’s customers are industrial, medical,
                and military. They need high-fidelity simulators for training purposes. Photogrammetry can help in
                mapping the detailed surfaces of an environment such as a fighter jet cockpit, he says, which in turn
                can help to convey the feeling of complex physical interactions such as buttons, dials, or switches.</p>
            <p>Rubin suggests that theme parks or arcades might be the first places users will experience this type of
                technology in an entertainment setting, probably within three to five years. “The price should come down
                with volume,” he says, which will make the technology more available to media makers.</p>

            <p>What’s coming next down the pike for haptic experiences? Some we’ve already grown used to—such as Apple’s
                “<a
                    href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/16/09/27/inside-the-iphone-7-apples-taptic-engine-explained">taptic
                    engine</a>,” which mimics the feel of buttons, taps, and <a
                    href="https://www.imore.com/how-send-someone-your-heartbeat-apple-watch-iphone">simulated
                    heartbeats</a> that lovers can share across distance. Apple’s <a
                    href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uifeedbackgenerator">Taptic API</a> now allows
                developers to create apps with their own haptic features. Here’s an <a
                    href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/user-interaction/feedback/">interesting
                    breakdown</a> of the different types of feedback that are available, and an <a
                    href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/09/25/video-iphone-6s-taptic-engine/">X-ray</a> of the
                engine in action.</p>
            <p>Select arcade games have featured haptic feedback for many years, such as racing simulators. For the
                masochist, newer <a
                    href="https://www.wired.com/story/haptic-controllers-for-vr-bring-real-pain-to-games/">haptic game
                    accessories</a> can simulate the pain of a kick in the ribs, a punch in the face or a “yelp-inducing
                pinch,” reports Zara Stone in <em>Wired.</em></p>
            <p>So-called “teledildonics” have also been a focal point in the development of haptic technology. David
                Parisi, an associate professor of emerging media at the College of Charleston, offers a capsule history
                in his new book, <em><a
                        href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/archaeologies-of-touch">Archaeologies of
                        Touch: Interfacing with Haptics from Electricity to Computing</a></em><em>.</em></p>
            <p>He details the rise and fall of the RealTouch system, which synched up the action in pornographic films
                to a USB-enabled sheath. Somewhat surreally, Parisi explains, “adding haptics to the videos required the
                coders to move scene-by-scene through the library, imagining what the scene would feel like on their own
                genitals, and then assigning that complex of sensations a string of numerical values to control the
                operation of the motors, the release of the lubricant, and the temperature of the device’s interior.”
            </p>
            <p>By 2012, the RealTouch allowed for remote manipulation of the device, shifting it from a media-driven
                experience to one managed by a human operator. This continued what Parisi describes as an ongoing effort
                to naturalize such devices and sensations. This new configuration aimed to “erase the distance between
                the desiring male body and the females and males captured in [the Adult Entertainment Broadcast
                Network’s] vast archive.” While the RealTouch eventually failed due to patent disputes, its evolution
                suggests the trajectory of touch technology—towards the ever-more authentic and multi-dimensional.</p>
            <p>Through the looking glass, what happens when devices designed initially for touch begin telling stories
                of their own? Parisi notes that more recent improvements in sex toys have been aimed at women. The
                latest wrinkle is making them more networked.</p>
            <p>“White hat hackers have already exposed a number of adult companies — <a
                    href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/compromising-unencrypted-butt-plug-comms/">Lovense</a>,

                — as unstable repositories for the surprisingly detailed stores of intimate user data they’ve been
                collecting, mostly unbeknownst to their customers,” <a

                Claire Lampen for Gizmodo. On the plus side, after your wired vibrator’s been hacked, perhaps it can <a

                    you a pizza</a> to help you eat your feelings.
            </p>
            <p>“2018 is shaping up to be the year of <a href="https://vrscout.com/news/state-of-input-vr-hands/">haptic
                    feedback</a>,” reports Kyle Melnick for <a
                    href="https://vrscout.com/news/grasp-touch-trigger-vr-microsoft-claw/#">VR Scout</a>. Microsoft’s
                new CLAW allows users to grasp, touch, and feel objects by simulating the tension of squeezing something
                hard or soft and allowing the user to feel its contours and surfaces. Of course, it also allows users to
                pull a trigger, offering the simulated feel of gun recoil.</p>
            <p>But no single gadget will suffice to move the field forward, Parisi suggests. “For a high-fidelity
                haptics system to enjoy widespread adoption akin to radio or television, it will have to function
                properly in its stated goal of delivering convincing touch sensations, no easy task in and of itself.
                But in order to justify the development of a shared cross-platform programming language, it will also
                have to thrive in the competitive marketplace of consumer electronics. Haptics will need to find a
                killer app — that one activity that robust, high-fidelity haptics would prove indispensable to.”</p>
            <p>Can such devices ever deliver the shock of recognition I experienced during <em>HERO—</em>of undeniable
                human connection? Even if so, can they effectively advance a storyline? That remains to be felt. But,
                for now, the boundaries between the real and the simulated just keep on shrinking.</p>
