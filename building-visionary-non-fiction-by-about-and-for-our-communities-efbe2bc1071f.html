            <p>In <a href="https://immerse.news/this-is-the-moment-for-visionary-narratives-7db0d9797ec1#.mq3n0gdmk">her
                    contribution</a> to issue #3 of<em> Immerse</em>, Adrienne Maree Brown so elegantly lays out the
                imperative for collaborative creative work as a foundation for visionary fiction that has the potential
                and mission to transform our communities and mindset. Through the read I kept thinking about how
                necessary such an approach is for storytelling generally, beyond speculative fiction and its role in
                community building and change. For non-fiction storytelling in particular, the field I am deeply
                immersed in, her methodology is a welcome breath of fresh air, and the use of Octavia Butler’s work as a
                reference and source of inspiration could not be more relevant to our current times and envisioning our
                future.</p>
            <p>In the work I do, I am constantly preoccupied with the how and the who of the storytelling. It’s a
                constant questioning of whether the process and daily practice of my work is allowing space for deep
                creative thinking, complexity of story and character and potential healing and change.</p>
            <p>How do we in the documentary/non-fiction world — including VR, interactive documentary, feature or short
                films, and whatever comes next — validate and maintain a trust in keeping the marginal at the center, in
                focus and empowered while staying faithful to the imaginative craft of our storytelling as artists
                invested in change? I think Brown and DNA have a blueprint for us.</p>
            <p>A critical element of visionary non-fiction lies in the notion of telling stories by us. The stories we
                choose to tell are so dependent on who tells those stories. POV reveals so much. Everything emerges from
                there.</p>
            <p>Putting the storyteller at the center of the work is key to deeper structural shifts and change, but also
                to greater creativity. More space needs to be created that provides opportunity to explore our own
                stories and embrace failure as part of becoming better at our craft. But too much often seems to be at
                stake to allow for that crucial room. And the message from funders is often mixed at best.</p>
            <p>Through collaborative work that focuses on our community as creators, subjects and audience/users, the
                possibilities are infinite. On the other side of the non-fiction storytelling coin, too little
                questioning occurs when storytellers from outside the community engage in telling our stories. Where and
                when could visionary non-fiction allow for process, collaboration and self-reflection on a storyteller’s
                baggage and potential position of power? Can DNA provide some clues on process for that type of
                insider-outsider engagement as artists?</p>
            <p>I dug a bit deeper into the visionary fiction work laid out in <em>Octavia’s Brood</em> and found that
                some of the tools discussed seemed familiar in an instinctive, almost unconscious way in the work I have
                embraced over the years. The work we have been doing at the <a href="http://radafilm.com/">Rada Film
                    Group</a> has always involved a practice of collaboration, process and especially exposing
                vulnerabilities that can allow us to free our imagination about our past, present and future.</p>

            <p>This year we are eagerly wetting our feet and creating a time travel story in the VR space. In the work,
                process is key — investing in the journey to making that story or creating a community engagement
                campaign that truly embraces and involves those of us most affected by questions raised in our stories.
                <em>BUFU</em> (By Us For Us and About Us) are ideas that have driven my passion for non-fiction
                storytelling, as a response to the white gaze on my community where my agency is compromised. But also
                as a way of questioning my own complicated position of relative privilege and oppression, my
                relationships with subjects, audiences and creative collaborators.
            </p>
            <p>As Brown points out, By Us cannot be an individualistic endeavor in the creative process. Otherwise we
                end up perpetuating the same white supremacist structures we seek to dismantle and question. The process
                in creation as well as in outreach and engagement must embrace our collective interdependence. It is
                about who tells the story, how the story is told, and how we engage our community and who do we reach
                out to in order to create impact and change. These questions are fundamental to building new spaces in
                the art form, a visionary <em>non-fiction</em>.</p>
            <p>The way in which the practice of process and creativity have been embraced in Detroit with speculative
                fiction represents an urgent call to action for all storytellers. New media platforms present an
                opportunity to avoid repeating or maintaining the same oppressive paradigms in the spaces we can
                control. Front and center are not just the stories we tell, but who tells the stories — and for whom
                they tell them. The collaborative practice at DNA and the specific voices being engaged are by their
                very existence acts of a visionary present-day.</p>
