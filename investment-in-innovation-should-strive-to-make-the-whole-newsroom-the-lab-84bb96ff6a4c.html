            <p>Despite all the pressure for newsrooms to focus on clicks and views that drive programmatic ad buys,
                there are signs of a growing commitment for investing in innovation across news organizations.</p>
            <p>However, we must think carefully about how those investments are being made, what expectations
                organizations have for innovation initiatives, and how those initiatives have impact across newsrooms.
            </p>
            <p>To contrast with the examples in <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/booting-up-immersive-news-labs-b35382954c1b#.ter9e19oj">Aleszu Bajak’s
                    piece</a>, I’ll share the story of my own attempt to run just such a group.</p>
            <p>For 20 months, in 2015–2016, I worked with Univision/Fusion Media Group to found and run a Center for
                Innovation &amp; Engagement. Along with my colleague <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-rodr%C3%ADguez-tarditi-8471a434">Federico Rodriguez
                    Tarditi</a>, I took an approach significantly different than those Bajak covered.</p>
            <p>Our Center was not “a lab.” In fact, we didn’t make any experimental news products while we were there.
            </p>
            <p>Rather, our goal was to be an inspirer, an educator, a catalyst, and a facilitator for enabling as many
                different groups as possible to experiment with new ways to tell stories and new ways to connect with
                audiences, beyond what they were already naturally doing. In other words, we wanted as many teams as
                possible to feel innovation was their job and to support them in trying approaches that were realistic
                within their time and budget constraints.</p>
            <p>Most of that work involved matching an internal team with an external partner to explore something our
                teams hadn’t tried before. Sometimes, our work began with an internal team’s dream which they weren’t
                sure how to accomplish. Often, it involved bringing initiatives outside our walls to the attention of
                various teams internally, in hopes of enticing someone to play. But, in all these cases, we wanted to
                inspire our teams through these outside partnerships and bring that spirit of collaboration to as many
                groups as we could feasibly manage.</p>
            <p>We also found as many ways as we could to bring representatives from our teams into the spaces of
                external partners, most often through sponsoring and co-organizing conferences.</p>
            <p>As part of this work, we helped foster unique co-production relationships:</p>

                <li>We partnered our investigative team with a mobile game developer to explore gerrymanding

                </li>
                <li>We forged relationships between our teams and academic initiatives at places such as USC Annenberg
                    (examples <a href="http://interactive.fusion.net/rise-up-be-heard/">here</a>, <a

                </li>
                <li>We worked with nonprofit projects such as the Internet Archive’s Political TV Ad Archive (examples

                </li>
                <li>We tried using experimental platforms such as <a

                    and <a href="http://interactive.fusion.net/rise-up-be-heard/">Vojo</a> to tell unexpected stories
                    and/or tell those stories in new ways.</li>

                    partnered with the MIT Media Lab’s Laboratory for Social Machines to track the ways in which Trump’s
                    campaign dumbed down the <a
                        href="http://fusion.net/story/307056/donald-trump-twitter-and-immigration/">Twitter conversation
                        about immigration</a>.</span></figure>
            <p>But we believed a lot of innovation work wasn’t necessarily about creating stories using an experimental
                feature or platform. Our work included, for instance, research focused on understanding how better to
                serve our most dedicated audiences and finding pathways to better connect those doing research work on
                various teams across our portfolio of companies.</p>
            <p>We also incubated a new “community liaison” position, aimed at connecting our teams’ stories to the
                communities most likely to care about them most deeply (See a bit about their work in this <a
                    href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/09/heres-a-peek-inside-fusions-center-for-innovation-engagement/">Nieman
                    Lab feature</a>).</p>
            <p>Through this team, and other partnerships, we sought to foster ongoing relationships with community
                members to better understand underreported issues and, where possible, to find opportunities to feature
                those voices directly. I firmly believe that finding new ways to maintain productive relationships with
                the communities served by your work, and exploring new co-creation storytelling approaches, is among the
                most vital long-term innovation work for journalism.</p>
            <p>Across all this work was another common concern: metrics. As the old methods of measuring reach, views,
                clicks, and shares proves increasingly untenable, it’s crucial for innovation work within an
                organization to be dedicated to means of measurement like depth of engagement, completion rate, story
                shelflife, and projects that help to establish and strengthen the strength of the news organization’s
                brand. (More on this in my recent <a
                    href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/12/the-year-we-talk-about-our-awful-metrics/">Nieman Lab 2017
                    prediction piece</a>.)</p>
            <p>When significant layoffs came to Univision, though, our Center was swept up in that tide.</p>
            <p>That is a common refrain for innovation groups and labs inside a news organization; even when the budgets
                are lean for such groups, they can seem among the hardest for companies to justify keeping through a
                change in leadership or a quarter that doesn’t meet financial expectations.</p>
            <p>In fact, that precariousness of news organizations’ commitment to invest in innovation is why I think
                it’s especially important for newsrooms to work with partners in academia and at nonprofits, who are
                less likely to have their focus on crucial long-term questions disrupted by shifting momentary company
                priorities, this month’s traffic goals, or budget shortfalls.</p>
            <p>And that precariousness is also why it’s crucial for innovation efforts to emphasize making the whole
                company “the lab.” Too often, you can’t be sure how long investments in these efforts within a newsroom
                will last, so making sure experimentation isn’t quarantined is key for knowing you’ve had a lasting
                impact.</p>
