            <p>This year, I attended the Immersive program at Tribeca Film Festival for the first time. Since I joined
                MIT’s Open Documentary Lab as a researcher last year, I’ve attended many online seminars that highlight
                the different ways mixed reality technologies can be used to tell stories. Thus, I came into the
                festival looking forward to experiencing first-hand the type of projects and technologies that I had
                previously mostly experienced through online platforms.</p>
            <p>Storyscapes<em> — </em>Tribeca Immersive’s in-person exhibit at 50 Varick Street in Lower Manhattan<em> —
                </em>consisted of five projects from eight countries. From what I’ve heard, Storyscapes has been packed
                with VR enthusiasts in previous years. Yet this year didn’t feel so crowded; with tickets sold for a
                specific time and date, only four people at a time could experience the projects. As I waited for my
                time slot, I read <em>Jupiter Invincible</em>, an augmented reality comic book series about an enslaved
                African American, as it was on display as part of the festival’s Juneteenth programming. I then entered
                the venue, where I had the opportunity to immerse myself in a unique and colorful installation that
                primed me for the experience that would come as soon as I put on my headset.</p>
            <p>My initial impression of Tribeca’s Storyscapes in person was very similar to what I had experienced
                online at virtual Sundance New Frontier in January 2021, both in terms of aesthetics and organization.
                Moving through the physical space of Storyscapes felt very similar to exploring the virtual space of New
                Frontier. One drawback of attending the festival physically was that, by design, I had to experience all
                the projects in a sequential order, which made the experience more standardized for attendees. In
                addition, I was worried that having to see all projects within a limited time window would increase the
                chances that I would develop motion sickness due to the continuous use of VR headsets. However, I was
                pleased that I completed the hour and a half exhibit without feeling dizzy at all. Although I believe
                that attending a festival in person has unique characteristics that are difficult to reproduce online,
                such as having the opportunity to be in a new place and meet other attendees in an organic social
                setting, as far as experiencing the projects themselves goes, I believe that both physical and online
                settings are similarly successful, especially as it pertains to mixed reality projects.</p>
            <p>In this edition of Storyscapes, three projects — <em>Critical Distance</em>, <em>Lovebirds of the Twin
                    Towers</em>, and <em>Kusunda</em> — explore the topic of eradication and the efforts to keep
                something alive. Within a custom-built screen projection cylinder, the only non-VR project at
                Storyscapes, Adam May and Chris Campkin’s <strong>Critical Distance</strong> takes us underwater into
                the audio soundscapes world of endangered orcas and their fragile ecosystem. Before starting, we were
                advised that the project was interactive and were encouraged to “touch” the whales to create a better
                experience. We put on the Microsoft Hololens 2 to commence. The experience uses augmented reality,
                projection, and holograms to portray a small group of 24 orcas — most notably, Kiki, a six-year-old
                female that lives off the coast of British Columbia. Sound was an important element for this experience.
                In the cylindrical structure, I figured out which direction to turn around to interact with new whales
                approaching me by locating where their sounds came from. Although the interactivity wasn’t as intuitive
                as I would’ve liked, I found myself smiling at how the whales illuminated when I “touched” them.</p>
            <p>The five-minute piece <strong>Lovebirds of the Twin Towers</strong> by Ari Palitz and Tim Dillon is one
                of the shorter works at Storyscapes. In it, Carmen and Arturo Griffith, former elevator operators at the
                World Trade Center, reminisce about how they fell in love at work, surviving the building collapse
                during the 9/11 attacks and the anguish they felt over five days after the event, when they did not know
                if the other had survived. Audiences have no interaction within the VR experience, but the 3D models of
                the Twin Towers are well-detailed and brought us back in time to visit them. After completing the VR
                section of the project, audiences are invited to talk with Carmen. She was filmed answering questions
                about her life using StoryFile’s AI platform. Audiences were able to ask defined questions to prompt the
                pre-recorded answers. I wanted to interact with Carmen within the VR headset but didn’t have a chance;
                once the VR film was over, my group jumped to the next project, only allowing me to ask one question.
                Moreover, I would have appreciated being able to ask other questions apart from the prompts that were
                displayed.</p>

            <p><strong>Kusunda</strong> — the winner of the Storyscapes Award — is a 23-minute experimental,
                speech-recognition VR docufiction about the Kusunda language. Created by Felix Gaedtke and Gayatri
                Parameswaran, this installation invites audiences to the mountains of Nepal. The project focuses on the
                language’s keepers, who are also co-creators of this project: 86-year-old shaman Lil Bahadur and his
                15-year-old granddaughter Hema. During the making of this project, the original protagonist, Gyani Maia
                Sen, one of the final speakers of Kusunda, unfortunately passed away, necessitating significant changes
                to the story. Gaedtke and Parameswaran included a video interview from Gyani at the beginning of the
                experience to honor her. They use photogrammetry for the environments and volumetric video to capture
                their other protagonists. For Lil Bahadur’s recollections of his past in the jungle, they used Tilt
                Brush and animations. Audience members must speak certain words in <em>Kusunda</em> to choose their own
                narrative journey. What struck me the most were the different techniques Gaedtke and Parameswaran used
                to solve challenges, both during the production and delivery of the documentary. For me,
                <em>Kusunda</em> is strongest as an exploration of the different possibilities and affordances of VR.

            </figure>
            <p>The other two installations, <em>Inside Goliath</em> by Barry Gene Murphy and May Abdalla and <em>We Are
                    at Home</em> by Michelle and Uri Kranot, are more gameplay-oriented. In <strong>Inside
                    Goliath</strong>, a visual installation and 12-minute VR piece, voiceover narration from the main
                character Joe guides you through the sense of living with schizophrenia and psychosis. You embark on a
                visual journey through what feels like a neon arcade aesthetic with bright colors and a lot of movement.
                I felt disoriented, and at times the experience became overwhelming. There is one moment in which you
                can choose between listening to an expert explaining the symptoms of this mental health disorder or
                Joe’s feelings and thoughts. The meta component, which was the part that I enjoyed the most, is an
                arcade game within the VR project that narrates Joe’s recollections throughout his life, such as
                avoiding people, consuming drugs and alcohol. In sum, the project advocates for a participatory
                audience; it encourages us to move, think, and talk.</p>
            <p><strong>We Are At Home</strong> is a beautifully hand-painted, animated 45-minute multi-user VR piece
                that animates the themes of intimacy and voyeurism from Carl Sandburg’s poem, “The Hangman at Home.” The
                directors were awarded the Grand Jury Prize for Best Immersive Work at the 2020 Venice Film Festival for
                their single-user version of this project. Even though the audience spends most of the time as
                disembodied observers, this project allows for both the most movement and participation: you can open
                doors, windows, and cabinets. Each one of these actions are portals that reveal different tableaus, five
                in total, of intimate and private moments of other lives. To begin the experience, you need to light a
                match with the hand-held controllers. Even though the staff members explained to me how to light it, the
                action wasn’t intuitive for me; I felt puzzled. But after several attempts and the infinite patience of
                the staff, I successfully lit the match. In retrospect, understanding the mechanics of the project
                before starting was key to enjoying the rest of it. When the fourth wall is broken, and the characters
                look directly at you, I found myself wondering, should I be here? I had spent so long observing the
                characters that I felt caught by surprise and I looked to the other side just to realize that I was in a
                “closed-room” without escape. The project explores different forms of engagement in which different
                scenes require audiences to play different roles. For example, there is a room in which I could interact
                with different objects — such as stir a tea bag or play a piano — that were excerpted from the previous
                scenes. This felt special because it was the point when I transitioned from being a passive observer to
                an active participant. The climax of the experience is when you are left with the task to burn a pile of
                books. You have no idea who is coming, but I, at least, felt the responsibility to burn those books. I
                immediately regretted it because the space around me started “burning”! As we stepped out of the
                Storyscapes building, I went back to my reality and wondered what I would have done had I been left with
                the responsibility of burning the books in real life.</p>
