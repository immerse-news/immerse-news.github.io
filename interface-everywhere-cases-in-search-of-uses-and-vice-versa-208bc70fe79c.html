            <p><em>This is the first installment of a new column by </em><a href="https://immerse.news/">Immerse</a><em>
                    editor Jessica Clark, “Interface Everywhere,” exploring the implications of storytelling and art at
                    the cusp of the physical and the digital.</em></p>
            <p>VEGAS<em>— </em>Up and down the strip, towering screens tout performers and pasta, <a
                    href="http://kre8outdooradvertising.com/iconic-mobile-billboard-build-out/">mobile billboards</a>
                boast intricate acrobat automata, a sultry pair of eyes surveils you from a rooftop, and in every
                direction, flashing, blinging lights lure cash out of your pockets. Reality and simulation mingle
                freely: a fake Eiffel tower cheek-to-jowl with a strangely spangly CVS. The mind reels.</p>

            <p>So, what could be a more fitting, immersive setting for the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the massive
                annual extravaganza of gadgets and gizmos? Engulfed by The Venetian — itself a hi-fi replica of a
                tourist phantasm — I strap on my badge, bag, and water bottle and trek to what’s called “Eureka Park.”
            </p>
            <p>There, I find a section of scrappy startup vendors busy eroding the boundaries between the physical and
                the digital. <a href="https://www.orqafpv.com/">Drone racers from Croatia</a> explain that their 360
                headset offers a more encompassing first-person view, allowing “you to fly 150 miles per hour with your
                feet on the ground.” A maker of <a href="https://bebopsensors.com/">tactile data gloves</a> allows me to
                pick up, plant, and water virtual seeds. I drool nostalgically over the <a
                    href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixbackpack/pix-the-first-smart-animative-backpack">Pix
                    backpack</a>, which displays a programmable animation reminiscent of a Lite-Brite, and the <a
                    href="http://www.cinemasnowglobes.com/">Cinema Snowglobe</a>. A video clip plays when you shake one
                of these, <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1YqGorEOXZjKv">explains</a> co-founder JD Beltran—like a
                digital picture frame with a “a better, cooler form-factor.” Even cooler: a larger “crystal ball”
                version.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/450/1*jC4cnqnPHc83rFgQw8Cftg.jpeg"

                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="544727006581044441"><span class="marginnote">The Scribit
                    is suspended on a wire between two nails, and wanders your walls drawing images that you
                    program.</span></figure>
            <p><a
                    href="https://scribit.design/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6Jm81Mnw4AIVjp6fCh3zDQDJEAAYASAAEgL83_D_BwE">Scribit</a>
                combines analog and digital elements in a new way: plotting out a drawing on a wall with custom markers
                that allow images to easily be written and erased. “Scribit is our response to the fact that today’s
                innovations are all bringing in more pixels, more stress, more information into our lives,” said Chief
                Marketing Officier Andrea Baldereschi. “We liked the idea of creating a piece of technology to remind us
                that beauty takes time to be achieved and take shape.” Easy to set up with just two nails and an outlet,
                this “write and erase robot” is designed to be used in homes, businesses, and educational settings.
                Multiple Scribits around the world can be programmed to draw the same picture simultaneously to
                facilitate collaboration or team building.</p>
            <p>Few of the vendors I spoke with had thought about storytelling or journalism applications for their
                products. Instead, they see “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case">use cases</a>” for more
                lucrative industries—telemedicine, defense, flight simulators, driverless transport, advertising.</p>
            <p>How would a filmmaker or journalist use data gloves? “That’s an interesting question,” reflected Maxime
                Stinnett of BeBop Sensors, the motto of which is “Make Things Knowable.” Perhaps it could be used to
                control documentary drones, he suggested, or for haptic reporting, in which the user could feel the
                thing being described. “We haven’t thought about it yet, to be honest,” said Ivan Jelusic of VR headset
                maker Orqa FPV, “but I’m very much sure that some smart people can come up with applications for that.”
            </p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Foy9NmLByWL4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Doy9NmLByWL4&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Foy9NmLByWL4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"

            <p>My suggestion that the Pix backpack could be used as a roving news ticker was a new one—hard but not
                impossible given that you program the animations one at a time from a related app. “All of the best
                ideas are in your mind, not mine,” said Baldereschi—a refrain which suggests a wide open field for
                documentarians and other creators of nonfiction narrative to seize upon emerging tools and find
                compelling uses for them.</p>
            <p>For me, a clear takeaway from CES is that the “user interface” as it is commonly understood has
                officially exploded. No longer limited to an interaction on a screen or with a joystick, the connections
                between humans and machines have moved both out into the world and more intimately inside the body.</p>
            <p>Of course, there were numerous screens of all sizes on display (<a
                    href="https://www.cnet.com/news/ces-2019-shows-the-foldable-phone-revolution-will-be-awkward-but-essential/">including
                    the much-anticipated foldable ones</a>)—as well as eye-popping holographic displays such as <a
                    href="https://hypervsn.com/">Hypervsn</a>—<a
                    href="https://www.pscp.tv/beyondbroadcast/1zqKVOWbvRmGB">see my interview here</a>. But this year,
                with flagging headset sales, buzz about VR was on the wane, and AR/mixed/extended reality was on the
                rise.</p>

            <p>For storytellers, this presents interesting interface challenges, as whatever is being superimposed upon
                the world around the viewer has to blend well with the background. When I tried the Nreal Light —a
                pioneering mixed reality headset that looks and feels like regular sunglasses—the 3D images were
                impressive but made little sense superimposed on passing conference-goers. Complete with prescription
                lenses for users that need them, these take a big step towards making augmented reality more
                consumer-friendly. But again, this is a case in search of a better use.</p>

                    USGS, SETI and other sources.</span></figure>
            <p>One nice example of form, content, and function melding intelligently was <a
                    href="https://www.astroreality.com/">AstroReality’s</a> AR moon, earth and planets, which allow
                users to hold a 3D-printed model of a celestial body and zoom into it with an app to get related
                information backed up by data from NASA. How and where this might be used was clear: in classrooms,
                planetariums, and the homes of astronomy enthusiasts, in the same way globes were in our not-so-distant
                past. The companion <a href="https://www.astroreality.com/lunar-ar-notebook/learn-about-the-moon">AR
                    notebook</a> adds a fun <em>Harry Potter</em>-style taste of the experience for people who can’t
                afford the models themselves. (Full disclosure—they gave me a free one since I was there covering CES.
                <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/beyondbroadcast/1gqxvnZqPWjxB">See the demo here</a>.)
            </p>
            <p>If mixed reality breaks the fourth wall between the viewer and the experience in new ways, some gadgets
                on display at CES breach previously sacrosanct boundaries between bodies and machines. <a
                    href="https://www.tryhealium.com/">Healium XR</a> uses a “brain sensing headband” in conjunction
                with an app or VR googles to track users’ stress levels and prompt them to more sanguine states while
                watching “therapeutic stories” that they can influence with real-time EEG feedback. The <a
                    href="https://dreem.com/">Dreem band</a> also tracks brain activity, plus movement and heart rate,
                to monitor sleep quality and pipe sleep-inducing tracks into your inner ear via bone conduction. Sounds
                relaxing.</p>

                moms-to-be to snap their own in-utero candids of the “first smile of life,” while the <a

                stage of gestation. (Strangely enough, pregnancy’s fine, but <a

                table.) At CES, it seems that practically anything on a human can become an interface: your <a
                    href="https://skiin.com/">skin</a>, your <a
                    href="https://qz.com/1194838/carnival-ocean-medallion-a-disney-magicband-for-cruises/">jewelry,</a>
                your <a href="http://www.e-vone.com/our-shoes/?lang=en">shoes</a>. No more just buying a shirt and
                wearing it—geotagged garments from Awear Solutions gather info about when and how a garment is worn, and
                connect to a <a

                    hunt game</a> which rewards you for wearing it to particular locations.</p>
            <p>While such new possibilities offer exciting creative options for storytellers, it’s all a bit
                overwhelming. After traipsing through several exhibit halls on my first day at CES, I retreated to a
                readymade immersive environment: the <a href="https://www.sbsmobilier.fr/laboiteareves">Dream Box</a>,
                which promised to balm my nerves with chromotherapy and an enclosed nap space. By day two, I retreated
                to yet another simulation—the Salt Grotto in the Venetian’s Canyon Ranch Spa, complete with soothing
                “sea air” (Quote marks are theirs) and ersatz twinkling stars. By day three, I was good and ready to
                flee Vegas for the nearby Mojave Desert with its actual rocks and sky.</p>

            <p>A month later, in Park City, it was a relief to return to the New Frontiers exhibition, where the tech
                was at least peripherally being put to use in service of stories and art. There I saw an old soliloquy
                reborn in <em>Seven Ages of Man, </em>a volumetric capture of an actor performing Shakespeare’s famous
                speech from <em>As You Like It, </em>which aptly observes that “all the world’s a stage.” The piece,
                experienced via a Magic Leap AR headset, allows viewers to walk around a 3D figure of the actor, blended
                with CGI animation, and a physical set. At this point the tech is relatively seamless, enough so that
                it’s possible to concentrate on the content rather than just the novelty of the experience.</p>
            <p>“We’re here at Sundance to share how theater and this world are colliding, and how we look at performance
                in new ways,” said Sarah Ellis, the director of digital development at the Royal Shakespeare Company.
                The hope is that by making such immersive experiences available anywhere, audiences won’t be
                disenfranchised by their location. “It’s how we extend theater into to the multiple stages we have
                today.” The process involves not just new tools but “new craft,” she says—a mixed reality device allows
                audience members to see one another, recreating the communal experience of live performance.</p>

                    Bowl with Samaria Rice. Photo courtesy of Oculus.</span></figure>
            <p>Another strong piece in the New Frontier exhibition that combined physical and digital elements was
                <em><a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/traveling-while-black-vr-sundance-1203118200/">Traveling
                        While Black</a></em><em>. </em>Participants sat down inside a a recreation of a booth in
                DC-based restaurant Ben’s Chili Bowl to experience VR conversations with locals and civil rights
                activists set in a similar booth. The feeling of being there in the scene was palpable, and the
                discussions were bracing, reflecting on historical and contemporary prejudice.
            </p>
            <p>During one conversation with Samaria Rice—the mother of Tamir Rice, shot in Cleveland in 2014—the
                restaurant’s patrons form a circle around the booth, serving as witnesses. Coproducer Ayesha Nadarajah
                explained that the team came up with that idea for the scene the day they were filming. “We wanted her
                to feel that she was surrounded by a supportive community. She said the presence of those people made
                her feel safe.” Because the experience can be intense, the team created the setting of the booths to
                give participants their own safe space to reflect and recover. A <a

                    version of the film</a> is available from the <em>New York Times, </em>but the sense of being inside
                of it is hard to match.</p>

            <p>Other pieces were less serious, but still intriguing. One favorite: <em><a
                        href="https://www.marshmallowlaserfeast.com/experiences/sweet-dreams/">Sweet Dreams</a></em>, by
                Marshmallow Laser Feast, offered a whimsical morality tale about gluttony set in Luscious Delicious
                Land—a place where people get so greedy, they end up consuming the universe itself. Throughout the
                experience participants are asked to taste various items while wearing a VR headset, and the tingly,
                tart, surprising flavors are almost distracting enough to counter the fact that much of the story is set
                at the teetering edge of a giant gullet.</p>
            <p>What would it take to bring some of this—history, heart, prankster creativity—to the seemingly soulless
                halls of CES? There’s surely some sweet cash to be made in improving the user interfaces for insane
                all-you-can-gorge tech shows. But that’s a challenge for another column.</p>
