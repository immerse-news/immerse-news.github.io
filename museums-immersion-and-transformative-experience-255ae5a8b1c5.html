    <h1>Museums, Immersion, and Transformative Experience</h1>
    <p class="meta"><a href="https://medium.com/u/e51cbf140ba4">Desi Gonzalez</a> on 2019-08-07</p>

        <section>
            <p>There’s little doubt that the best way to pick up and learn a new language is through immersion. Removed
                from the creature comforts of a native tongue and surrounded by unfamiliar words, phonemes, and syntax,
                the brain rewires.</p>
            <p>In <em>Virtual Art: From Illusion to Immersion</em>, art and media historian Oliver Grau describes the
                experience of immersive media as “mentally absorbing and a process, a change, a passage from one mental
                state to another.” As with language immersion — which often means being embedded in a place and culture
                that is different from one’s own — such experiences have the potential to transport a person from their
                day-to-day to a wholly new mental place, transforming the way they understand the world.</p>
            <p>In the Knight Foundation’s <em>On View</em> podcast episode “The Newcomers,” Vince Kadlubek, CEO and
                co-founder of Meow Wolf, posits that his Sante Fe-based arts organization’s wildly popular immersive
                storytelling exhibitions reflect a societal step beyond the experience economy to the transformation
                economy. No longer are consumers willing to settle for any old experience; now, people want to “pay for
                a <em>transformational</em> experience,” one that leaves them changed in some way. <em>On View </em>host
                Chris Barr follows up: “For an experience to be transformational, it has to provide <em>meaning</em>.”
            </p>
            <p>Seen in the context of capitalism, the idea of consuming transformation concerns me. Can meaningful
                change be purchased? Can individuals repeatedly expect transformation with every transaction, at the
                snap of a finger or the opening of a wallet?</p>
            <p>As a museum technologist, I’m committed to harnessing emerging technologies to deepen a visitor’s
                relationship with the objects and stories on view. I’ll always remember a moment at my former place of
                work, the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, that demonstrated the power of immersive technology. Between
                1964 and 1966 Warhol created almost 500 screen tests in his Silver Factory studio using his trusty Bolex
                camera. He would then project them in the studio but at a slower rate, resulting in ethereal silent
                films — intense close-up character studies of individuals both famous and unknown.</p>
            <p>At the museum, we created the Screen Test Machine, an interactive experience that allows visitors to be
                the subject of a Warhol short film. In an architectural space that harkens back to the aluminum
                foil-covered brick walls of Warhol’s studio, visitors sit in front of a Bolex camera that we gutted and
                replaced with a digital camera. After filming, the Screen Test Machine slows down the black-and-white
                video and sends it to their email inbox.</p>

                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="8506900940581051972"><span class="marginnote">Screen Test
                    Machine at the Andy Warhol Museum</span></figure>
            <p>I once watched a woman sit for a screen test, her gaze rapt in a staring contest with the camera’s lens.
                The minute the whirring of the camera subsided and recording stopped, her shoulders slumped, her face
                transforming from one of concentration to relief. She said to her friend: “I felt like I was there, an
                aspiring starlet in Warhol’s studio.”</p>
            <p>I see museums as essential to retaining real, meaningful transformation through immersion. Through their
                mission-based work and often-non-profit status, cultural institutions sidestep some — although
                admittedly, not all — of the profit-driven impulse of the transformation economy. For artists and museum
                professionals, the zenith of their work is to provide meaning that leaves a person changed in some way.
                At the same time, they recognize that transformation is gradual, a result of visitors bridging their
                lived experiences with outside knowledge to synthesize into new meaning.</p>
            <p>Even though Kadlubek describes the transformation economy as society’s next evolution, museums have long
                been sites of immersion and transformation. Museums are perfect sites of transformation precisely
                because curators and artists can present objects and stories that catalyze new thinking, offer
                interpretation and layers of knowledge to help contextualize those objects and stories, and provide a
                space for reflection and discussion.</p>
            <p>In <em>Shivers Down Your Spine: Cinema, Museums, and the Immersive View</em>, Alison Griffiths traces the
                historical forebears of museological immersion. The medieval cathedral uses the monumentality of its
                architecture to evoke the religious sublime. She contends that the “revered gaze” developed within the
                walls of the cathedral — “a way of encountering and making sense of images…that are intended to be
                spectacular in form and content.” Cultural institutions today continue to employ such techniques,
                whether in the gallery or on the IMAX screen.</p>
            <p>In the nineteenth century, artists developed panoramic paintings: large-scale, 360-degree images
                depicting historical scenes, military feats, or awe-inspiring landscapes, fully surrounding the
                audience. Artists painted traveling panoramas on transportable canvas scrolls, allowing the makers to
                tour their images at venues such as theaters and ballrooms for a seated audience to enjoy, often
                accompanied by narration and piano music.</p>
            <p>Even the earliest museums integrated immersive elements to bring their objects and stories to life. In
                <em>Highbrow/Lowbrow: The Emergence of Cultural Hierarchy in America</em>, Lawrence W. Levine points to
                one of the United States’ first museums as an example.</p>

                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="7567378571160281641"><span class="marginnote">A portrait
                    of Charles Willson Peale in his museum</span></figure>
            <p>Charles Willson Peale founded his museum in Philadelphia in 1786 to house the botanical, animalian, and
                archaeological specimens he collected during scientific expeditions. Peale was committed to elevating
                the scientific standards in his institution: he adopted the biological Linnaean taxonomy to classify
                objects within his collection, in contrast to counterparts who often presented their collections as
                oddities of the natural world. Still, Levine argues, he hoped to “make his museum a source of
                enlightenment <em>and</em> ‘rational amusement.’ ” He developed the progenitor of today’s natural
                history museum staple — the diorama — by painting landscape backdrops for his taxidermy specimens. By
                inserting the stuffed creatures into lifelike scenes, Peale simultaneously delighted audiences while
                connecting the object to its original context.</p>
            <p>If immersion has been an integral part of museums throughout their history, so have the anxieties that
                such immersion is taking away from institution’s educational missions and pandering to the whims of the
                masses. According to Levine, museums in the early nineteenth century were a part of the larger culture
                that fluidly blended education with entertainment. But this would quickly change around the middle of
                the century. Griffiths points to moral panics among museum staffers that are not so dissimilar to what
                you might hear at a cultural institution today.</p>
            <p>At the 1906 British Museums Association conference, one critic argued that the dioramic tendency in
                natural history museums had gone too far, to the point of severing museum-goers from the natural world:
            </p>
            <p><em>Slabs of nature were transported bodily into museum cases and their lessons rendered so obvious that
                    people found it easier to stroll into a museum to learn the habits of animals than to lie in wait
                    for them in their native fields…Thus, instead of creating naturalists, our museum helped people to
                    lose the naturalist’s chief faculty — observation.</em></p>
            <p>Often, the moral panics took on a classist dimension. The official guide of the 1874 International
                Exhibition reminded readers that “the main object of this series of Exhibitions is not the bringing
                together of great masses of works, and the attraction of great holiday-making crowds but the instruction
                of the public in art, science, and manufacture.” As Griffiths notes, the fear of “holiday people” — code
                for working class — disrupted the association of cultural institutions as something for an educated
                gentry.</p>

            <p>MIT’s Open Documentary Lab <a href="https://momentsofinnovation.mit.edu/immersion">Moments of Innovation
                    Timeline</a> highlights a panoply of other media that serve as precursors to today’s immersive
                storytelling technologies. From stereoscope images to planetarium documentaries, we’ve long used
                emerging technologies of the time to transport us to places unknown, faraway, and awe-inspiring.</p>
            <p>As augmented, virtual, and mixed reality mature, museums have new ways to engage audiences through
                immersion. Instead of falling into the age-old debate of whether these technologies are better suited to
                educate or entertain (in itself, a false dichotomy), I hope to move beyond these conversations. Instead,
                I’m more interested in exploring what makes for a transformative immersive experience in today’s
                cultural and political climate.</p>
            <p>The <em>New Dimensions in Testimony</em> project, a joint initiative of the USC Shoah Foundation and the
                USC Institute for Creative Technologies, uses artificial intelligence and 3D capture to bring recordings
                of interviews with Holocaust survivors to life. Visitors to Holocaust museums such as the ones in
                Washington, D.C., and Houston can now pose questions to the interviewees and receive answers in real
                time.</p>

            <p>With the rise of white supremacy in the United States and an increase in hate crimes and mass murders
                targeting Jewish people, it becomes all the more essential to preserve these stories. It’s invigorating
                to see cutting-edge technologies used in the service of advancing, <a
                    href="http://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/new-dimensions-in-testimony/">as the project’s website puts
                    it</a>, “the age-old tradition of passing down lessons through oral storytelling.”</p>
            <p>While <em>New Dimensions in Testimony</em> relies on emerging technology to create a sense of immersion,
                the National Museum of African American History and Culture reverts to tried-and-true techniques. From
                the museum’s Middle Passage gallery — devoted to the transatlantic slave trade of the fifteenth through
                nineteenth centuries — visitors can take a sharp right turn into a dimly lit and secluded gallery.</p>
            <p>There, I stepped gingerly onto a narrow wooden pathway, surrounded by weathered walls evocative of a
                slave ship. A spotlight illuminated two powerful objects from the Portuguese slave ship São Jose: an
                iron ballast — used to weigh down the boat and its human cargo — and a wooden pulley block. The ship
                departed from Mozambique in 1794, a few weeks into the journey towards Brazil before a crash into
                submerged rocks sunk the ship. It’s the first and only shipwrecked slave ship ever discovered.</p>
            <p>Divorced of their context, the iron ballast and wooden pulley block appear unremarkable. But through the
                use of architecture, lighting, and the juxtaposition of a few choice quotations, NMAAHC was able to
                bring the original meaning <em>back</em> to these objects. Confronting these objects, I was shaken out
                of my own context and immersed in the eighteenth century. I was struck by the atrocity of centuries of
                the trans-Atlantic slave trade and enslavement in the Americas that continue to impact our society
                today.</p>
            <p>To be clear, I was transformed because of the weight of history that these objects represented. But
                immersion was the vehicle that allowed me to be so.</p>
