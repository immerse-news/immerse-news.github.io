            <p>I don’t have children myself. My brother has children that I smile at from afar on Facebook. I keep an
                eye on them and make sure they’re okay. Transmedia isn’t mine either, but I keep an eye on her too. She
                isn’t around home like she used to be. Some of you are wondering where she is, asking: What happened to
                her? She is fine. Transmedia is a tween.</p>
            <p>She has grown up! She doesn’t need us around all the time, doesn’t need anyone to carry her, dress her,
                feed her. That is why it seems quieter. By <a

                    reckoning</a> there are only three fathers out there, meeting at the park around the transmedia
                hashtag. But she has grown up, so evangelists aren’t needed as much as before.</p>
            <p>She needs a different kind of parenting now (and don’t forget to include all the mothers next time too).
                There are plenty of parenting books out there (some for kids, some for tweens), including:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>We could still ask, though: Why don’t more creatives make transmedia? Oh, a few things. Firstly, it can
                have a higher cognitive load. As I outline in <a
                    href="http://digraa.org/digraa-brisbane-2016/digra-australia-2016-queensland-symposium-programme/">my
                    forthcoming journal article about “design schema tension,”</a> it takes more effort to work with
                different mental models of creation: ones that work in film, TV, games, theatre, and so on. But I and
                others have been uncovering design approaches that reduce these tensions — more on these soon.</p>

            <p>For media makers, there is still the fear about being called a “generalist” or a “jack of all trades,
                master of none” (ignoring the actual last part of the quote “but oftentimes better than a master of
                one”). Interestingly, the idea that you have to specialize, that there is such a thing as an expert in a
                field, is a recent social construct.</p>
            <p>As Michael Espindola Araki explains, before industrialization objects of knowledge such as books and
                artworks were limited. Only some people had access to them. If those people had access to many texts —
                often logic, grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, music, geometry, astronomy, philosophy, medicine, theology,
                and jurisprudence — they would be called a polymath, or genius.</p>
            <p>But once books were produced en masse, and then later accessible to even more with the web, the notion of
                a polymath disappeared. Why? It simply is not possible for anyone to know “everything” and that carries
                over to someone knowing more than one thing. Instead, the new “guru” is the “expert” who specializes.
                Now, people are less open to others who can actually be good at more than one thing.</p>

            <p>To combat this, it’s important to note the benefit of being someone who comes at things from a different
                perspective. As Arthur Koestler argued in <em>The Act of Creation, </em><a
                    href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/05/20/arthur-koestler-creativity-bisociation/">bisociation
                    is creativity</a>. The bringing together of incompatible elements is what artists do. But more
                recently too, scientists are seeing the benefits of solving problems through “outside solvers” or people
                who have expertise in another field:</p>

            <p>And then there are our other misgivings. Earlier this year I put a call out to my network on Facebook and
                asked what obstacles, major hurdles, beliefs, or truths stop them or others from doing transmedia. Here
                are some of their responses (republished with permission):</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Budgets! It’s hard to get decent budgets for a comprehensive effort at the very beginning of a
                    project. Sometimes it’s more of a trickle. You do something, client/partner sees it and likes it,
                    then allocates a bit more budget to do more.<em> —Michael Knowlton</em></p>

                <p>I think, increasingly, I’m aware that it’s an activity that only really appeals to a minority. Making
                    something that genuinely appeals to a wide audience, and doesn’t set up a huge power dynamic between
                    your super fans and your casual audience is hard. We end up super serving a small number of
                    participants, and making a thin experience for the majority. This feels like a big barrier to me,
                    and like an obstacle for the maturing of the form.<em>— Kim Plowright</em></p>

                <p>Finding meaningfully sized audiences. It generally seems that transmedia, rather than acting as a
                    multiplier of your potential to reach people in the different mediums, acts as a divider
                    instead.<em>—Morgan Jaffit</em></p>

                <p>Expertise: in those few cases where we’ve found ourselves working on an IP that we could see
                    extending quite naturally across mediums, we have found ourselves at a loss about what to do in
                    those mediums that we have no experience with. Finding people to work with in our OWN medium is
                    bloody difficult. Finding someone with expertise in another medium, who gets what we’re on about and
                    shares our vision…well…that hasn’t happened on any project I’ve been part of. Not yet anyways.<em>”—

                <p>Because it’s new and generally different in format every time the audience don’t understand it, and
                    funders don’t understand it either. So a huge amount of work is needed to educate everyone every

            <p>A few months have passed since those responses and things have changed. Some of these people are back to
                making transmedia projects or have the answer to their problems.</p>
            <p>She is growing up fast. Now our parenting duties shift to nurture our transmedia tween to be decent,
                wise, to reach high, think deep, and bring out the best in lots of people. She may rebel, she’s a tween.
                I intend to rebel.</p>
            <p>Indeed, next year I’ll be bringing out my book and design kit that counters the rules/principles/myths of
                transmedia. I’ve had some epiphanies these last few years, based on my creative projects, <a
                    href="http://www.forwardslashstory.com/">lab</a>, discussions, research, observations, and
                reflections. I think we’ve been looking with the wrong viewpoint at transmedia, and a lot of our
                problems are being resolved very quickly. We’re growing up alongside her. She is beautiful and very much
                alive and well, we just need turn around and see her.</p>
