                partnerships across the country to form networks that help newsrooms find and tell tough stories,
                connect them to those most affected and bring them to a national audience.”</p>

                original characters and inviting local residents to tell their contemporary stories. Of note: the
                ongoing nature of the project, continued engagement with the community, and experimentation with
