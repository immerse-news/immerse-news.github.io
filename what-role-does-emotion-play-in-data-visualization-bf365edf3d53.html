            <p><em>This article was adapted from </em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism">Data
                    Feminism</a><em>, a book by researchers Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein that explores “a way
                    of thinking about data and its communication that is informed by intersectional feminist thought and
                    action.”</em></p>
            <p>In 2012, twenty kindergarten children and six adults were shot and killed at an elementary school in
                Sandy Hook, CT. In the wake of this tragedy, and the weight of others like it, the design firm
                Periscopic started a new project — to visualize gun deaths in the United States. While there is no
                shortage of prior work in the form of bar charts or line graphs of deaths per year, Periscopic, a
                company whose tagline is “do good with data,” took a different approach.</p>
            <p>When you load<a href="http://guns.periscopic.com/?year=2013"> the webpage</a>, you see a single, arcing
                line that reaches out over time. Then, the color abruptly shifts from orange to white. A small dot drops
                down, and you see the phrase, “Alexander Lipkins, killed at 29.” The arc continues to stretch across the
                screen, coming to rest on the x-axis, where you see a second phrase, “could have lived to be 93.” Then,
                a second arc appears, displaying another arcing life. The animation speeds up over time, and the arcing
                lines increase, along with a counter that displays how many years of life have been “stolen” from these
                gun victims. After a couple of (long) minutes, the visualization moves through all of the year 2013,
                arriving at 11,419 people killed and 502,025 stolen years.</p>

                    2015. Images by Christopher Ingraham for the Washington Post.</span></figure>
            <p>What is different about Periscopic’s visualization than a more conventional bar chart of similar
                information such as “The era of ‘active shooters’” from the <em>Washington Post</em>?</p>
            <p>The Post’s graphic has a proposition — that active shooter incidents are on the rise — and demonstrates
                visual evidence to that effect. But Periscopic’s work is framed around a singular emotion: loss. People
                are dying, their remaining time on earth has been stolen from them. These people have names and ages. We
                presume they have parents and partners and children who also suffer from that loss. The data scientists
                who worked on the project used rigorous statistical methods and demographic information in order to
                infer how long that person would have lived, which are documented in their notes. But in spite of the
                statistical rigor, and its undeniable emotional impact, “U.S. Gun Deaths” drew mixed responses from the
                visualization community. We couldn’t decide: <em>Should a visualization evoke emotion?</em></p>
            <p>The received wisdom in technical communication circles is, emphatically, “NO.” In the recent book, <em>A
                    Unified Theory of Information Design,</em> the authors state: “The plain style normally recommended
                for technical visuals is directed toward a deliberately neutral emotional field, a blank page in effect,
                upon which viewers are more free to choose their own response to the information.” Here, plainness is
                equated with the absence of design, and thus greater freedom on the part of the viewer to interpret the
                results for themselves. Things like colors and icons, it is implied, work only to stir up emotions and
                cloud the viewer’s rational mind.</p>
            <p>In fact, in the field of data visualization, any kind of ornament has historically been viewed as
                suspect. Why? Well, as historian of science Theodore Porter puts it, “quantification is a technology of
                distance” and distance was historically imagined to serve objectivity by producing knowledge
                independently of the people that make it. This echoes nineteenth-century statistician Karl Pearson’s
                exhortation for people to set aside their own feelings and emotions when it came to statistics. The more
                seemingly neutral, the more rational, the more true, the better.</p>
            <h3 id="1f43">Data visualization, “the unempathetic art”</h3>
            <p>At a data visualization master class in 2013, workshop leaders from the <em>Guardian</em> newspaper
                called spreadsheet data — those endless columns and rows — “clarity without persuasion.”</p>
            <p>Back in the olden days of visualization, before the rise of the web elevated the visual display of data
                into a prized (and increasingly pervasive) artform, Edward Tufte, statistician, and statistical graphics
                expert, invented a metric for measuring the superfluous information included in a chart– what he called
                the “data-ink” ratio. In his view, a visualization designer should strive to use ink only to display the
                data. Any ink devoted to something other than the data itself — such as background color, iconography,
                or embellishment — should be immediately erased and, he all but says, the designer spat upon.</p>
            <p>Visual minimalism, according to this logic, appeals to reason first. (“Just the facts, ma’am,” says Joe
                Friday to every female character on Dragnet). Decorative elements, on the other hand, are associated
                with messy feelings — or, worse, represent stealthy (and, of course, unscientific) attempts at emotional
                persuasion. Data visualization has even been classified as the “unempathetic” art, in the words of
                designer Mushon Zer-Aviv, because of its emphatic rejection of emotion.</p>
            <p>The belief that women are more emotional than men (and that men are more reasoned than women) is one of
                the most persistent stereotypes in the world today. Indeed, psychologists have called it the “master
                stereotype,” and puzzled over how it endures even when certain emotions– even extreme ones, like anger
                and pride– are simultaneously coded as male.</p>
            <p>But what happens if we let go of the binary logic for a minute and posit two questions to challenge this
                master stereotype. First, is visual minimalism really more neutral? And second, how might activating
                emotion<em> </em>— leveraging it, rather than resisting emotion in data visualization — help us learn,
                remember, and communicate with data?</p>
            <h3 id="57b8">Crafting data stories from a standpoint</h3>
            <p>Information visualization has diverse historical roots. In its most recent, web-based incarnation, many
                of data visualization’s theorists and practitioners have come from technical disciplines aligned with
                engineering and computer science, and have not been trained in the most fundamental of all Western
                communication theories: <em>rhetoric</em>.</p>
            <p>In the ancient Greek treatise of the same name, Aristotle defines rhetoric as “the faculty of observing
                in any given case the available means of persuasion.” Rhetoric does not (only) consist of political
                speeches made by men in robes on ancient stages. Any communicating object that makes choices about the
                selection and representation of reality is a rhetorical object. Whether or not it is rhetorical (it
                always is) has nothing to do with whether or not it is “true” (it may or may not be).</p>
            <p>Why does the question of rhetoric matter? Well, because “a rhetorical dimension is present in every
                design,” as Jessica Hullman, a researcher at the University of Washington, says of data visualization.
                This includes visualizations that do not deliberately intend to persuade people of a certain message. We
                would say that it <em>especially and definitively</em> includes those so-called “neutral” visualizations
                that do not appear to have an editorial hand. In fact, those might even be the most perniciously
                persuasive visualizations of all!</p>
            <p>Editorial choices become most apparent when compared with alternative choices. For example, in his book
                <em><a href="https://legacy.gitbook.com/download/pdf/book/towcenter/curious-journalist-s-guide-to-data">The
                        Curious Journalist’s Guide to Data</a></em>, journalist Jonathan Stray discusses <a
                    href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/05/business/economy/one-report-diverging-perspectives.html">a
                    data story from the New York Times about the September 2012 jobs report</a>. The Times created two
                graphics from the report — one framed from the perspective of Democrats (the party in power at the time)
                and one framed from the perspective of Republicans.

            <p>Either of these graphics, considered in isolation, appears to be neutral and factual. The data are
                presented with standard methods (line chart and area chart respectively) and conventional positionings
                (time on the x-axis, rates expressed as percentages on the y-axis, title placed above the graphic).
                There is a high data-ink ratio in both cases, and very little in the way of ornamentation. But the
                graphics have significant editorial differences. The Democrats’ graphic emphasizes that unemployment is
                decreasing — in its title, the addition of the thick blue arrow pointing downwards, and the annotation
                “Friday’s drop was larger than expected.” Whereas, the Republicans’ graphic highlights the fact that
                unemployment has been steadily high for the past three years — through the use of the “8% unemployment”
                reference line, the choice to use an area chart instead of a line, and, of course, the title of the
                graphic. So neither graphic is neutral but both graphics are factual. As Jonathan Stray says, “the
                constraints of truth leave a very wide space for interpretation.” And importantly, in data
                communication, it is impossible to avoid interpretation (unless you simply republish the September Jobs
                Report as your visualization, but then it wouldn’t be a visualization).</p>
            <p>Hullman and co-author Nicholas Diakopoulous wrote <a
                    href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/vis_rhetoric.pdf">an influential paper</a> in
                2011 introducing concepts of rhetoric to the information visualization community. Their main argument is
                that visualizing data involves editorial choices — some things are necessarily highlighted, while others
                are necessarily obscured. When designers make these choices, they carry along with them “framing
                effects,” which is to say they have an impact on how people interpret the graphics and what they take
                away from them.</p>
            <p>For example, it is standard practice to cite the source of one’s data. This functions on a practical
                level — so that a reader may go out and download the data themselves. But this choice also functions as
                what Hullman and Diakopoulous call <em>provenance rhetoric</em> designed to signal the transparency and
                trustworthiness of the presentation source to end-users. This trust between the designers and their
                audience, in turn, increases the likelihood that viewers will believe what they see.</p>
            <p>So if plain, “unemotional” visualizations are not neutral but are actually extremely persuasive, then
                what does this mean for the concept of neutrality in general? Scientists and journalists are just some
                of the people that get nervous and defensive when questions about neutrality and objectivity come up.
                Auditors and accountants get nervous, too. They often assume that the only alternative to objectivity is
                a retreat into complete relativism and a world in which everyone gets a medal for having an opinion. But
                there are other options.</p>
            <p>Rather than valorizing the neutrality ideal, and trying to expunge all human traces from a data product
                because of “bias,” feminist philosophers have offered alternative paths towards truth. Sandra Harding
                would posit a different kind of objectivity that strives for truth <em>at the same time</em> that it
                considers — and discloses — the standpoint of the designer. This has come to be called “standpoint
                theory.” It is defined by what Harding calls “strong objectivity” which acknowledges that regular-grade,
                vanilla objectivity is mainly made by mostly rich white guys in power and does not include the
                experiences of women and other minoritized groups.</p>
            <p>This myopia inherent in traditional “objectivity” is what provoked renowned cardiologist Dr. Nieca
                Goldberg to title her book <em>Women Are Not Small Men</em> because she found that heart disease in
                women unfolds in a fundamentally different way than in men. The vast majority of scientific studies —
                not just of heart disease, but of most medical conditions — are conducted on male subjects, with women
                viewed as varying from this “norm” only by their smaller size. Harding and her colleagues would say that
                the key to fixing this issue is to acknowledge that all science, and indeed all work in the world, is
                undertaken by individuals, each with a particular standpoint: gender, race, culture, heritage, life
                experience, and so on.</p>
            <p>Rather than viewing these standpoints as threats that might <em>bias</em> our work — for, after all, even
                the standpoint of a rich white guy in power is a standpoint — we should embrace each of our standpoints
                as valuable perspectives that can <em>frame</em> our work. Our diverse standpoints can generate creative
                and wholly new research questions.</p>
            <h3 id="4b42">Making data visceral</h3>
            <p>Along with this embrace of our various standpoints goes the rebalancing of the false binary between
                reason and emotion. Since the early 2000s, there has been an explosion of research about “affect” — the
                term that academics use to refer to emotions and other subjective feelings– from fields as diverse as
                neuroscience, geography, and philosophy. This work challenges the thinking, inherited from Descartes,
                which casts emotion as irrational and illegitimate, even as it undeniably influences all of the social
                and political processes of our world. Evelyn Fox Keller, a physicist-turned-philosopher, famously
                employed the Nobel-prize-winning research of geneticist Barbara McClintock, in order to show how even
                the most profound of scientific discoveries are generated from a combination of experiment and insight,
                reason and emotion. And sociologist Patricia Hill Collins describes an ideal knowledge situation as one
                in which “neither ethics nor emotions are subordinated to reason.”</p>
            <p>Once we embrace the idea of leveraging emotion in data visualization, we can truly appreciate what sets
                Periscopic’s Gun Deaths apart from the <em>Washington Post</em> graphic, or any number of other gun
                death charts that have appeared in newspapers and policy documents.</p>
            <p>The <em>Washington Post</em> graphic represents death counts as blue ticks on a generic bar chart. If we
                didn’t read the caption, we wouldn’t know whether we were counting gun deaths in the U.S., haystacks in
                Kansas, exports from Malaysia, or any other semi-remote statistics of passing interest. But the
                <em>Periscopic</em> visualization leads with loss, grief, and mourning. It provides a visual language
                for representing the years that could have been — numbers that are accurate, but not technically facts.
                It uses pacing and animation to help us appreciate the scale of one life, and then compounds that scale
                11,419-fold. The magnitude of the loss, especially when viewed in aggregate, is a staggering and
                profound truth — and the visualization helps recognize it as such through our own emotions. Note that
                emotion and visual minimalism are not incompatible — the Periscopic visualization shows how emotion can
                be leveraged with visual minimalism for maximal effect.

            <p>Skilled data artists and designers know these things already, and are pushing the boundaries for what
                affective and embodied data visualization could look like. In 2010, Kelly Dobson founded the Data
                Visceralization research group at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) Digital + Media graduate
                program. The goal for this group was not to visualize data but to <em>visceralize</em> it. Visual things
                are for the eyes, but visceralizations are data that the whole body can experience– emotionally, as well
                as physically.</p>
            <p>The reasons for visceralizing data have to do with more than simply creative experimentation. How do
                visually impaired people access charts and dashboards? According to the World Health Organization, 253
                million people globally live with some form of visual impairment. In contrast to traditional navigation
                apps, Aimi Hamraie, director of the Mapping Access project at Vanderbilt University,<a
                    href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/11/city-apps-help-and-hinder-disability/574963/">
                    advocates for apps with multisensory navigation</a>. Hamraie writes, “Rather than relying entirely
                on visual representations of data, for example, digital-accessibility apps could expand access by
                incorporating ‘deep mapping,’ or collecting and surfacing information in multiple sensory formats. Such
                a map would be able to show images of the doorway or integrate turn-by-turn navigation. Deeper
                digital-accessibility maps can offer both audio and visual descriptions of spatial coordinates,
                real-time information about maintenance or temporary barriers, street views, and even video recordings.”
            </p>
            <p>Creators in the visceralization mode have crafted haptic data visualizations, data walks, data quilts,
                musical scores from scientific data, wearable objects that capture your breaths and play them back
                later, and data performances. These types of objects and events are more likely to be found in the
                context of galleries and museums and research labs, but there are many lessons to be learned from them
                for those of us who make visualizations in more everyday settings.</p>
            <p>For example, in the project <em><a href="https://vimeo.com/133815147">A Sort of Joy (Thousands of
                        Exhausted Things</a></em><a href="https://vimeo.com/133815147">)</a>, a theater troupe joined
                with a data visualization firm to craft a live performance based on metadata about the artworks held by
                New York’s Museum of Modern Art. With 123,951 works in its collection, MoMA’s metadata consists of the
                names of artists, the titles of artworks, their media formats, and their time periods. But how does an
                artwork make it into the museum collection to begin with? Major art museums and their collection
                policies have long been the focus of feminist critique, starting at least from Linda Nochlin’s canonical
                1971 essay, “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?” Whose work gets collected in museums and
                galleries? For our purposes, who is collected translates into who is counted in the annals of history —
                and, as you might guess, this history has mostly consisted of a parade of white male “masters.”</p>

            <p>In 1989, for example, the Guerrilla Girls, an anonymous collective of female artists, published what we
                would today call an infographic:<a

                </a><em><a
                        href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/guerrilla-girls-do-women-have-to-be-naked-to-get-into-the-met-museum-p78793">Do
                        women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?</a></em> The graphic was designed to be
                displayed on a billboard. However, it was rejected by the sign company because it “wasn’t clear enough.”
                (If you ask us, it’s pretty clear).</p>
            <p>The Guerrilla Girls then paid for it to be printed on posters that were displayed throughout the New York
                City bus system, until the bus company canceled their contract, stating that the figure “seemed to have
                more than a fan in her hand.” (It is definitely more than a fan). The figure is certainly provocative,
                but the poster also makes a data-driven argument by tabulating gender statistics for artists included in
                the Met collection and comparing them to the gender stats for the <em>subjects</em> of art included in
                the collection. As per the poster, the Met readily collects paintings in which women are the subjects,
                but not those in which women are the artists themselves.</p>
            <p><em>A Sort of Joy</em> deploys wholly different tactics to similar ends. The performance starts with a
                group of white men standing in a circle in the center of the room. They face out towards the audience,
                which stands around them. The men are dressed like stereotypical museum visitors: collared shirts,
                slacks, etc. Each wears headphones and holds an iPad on which the names of artists in the collection
                scroll by.</p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F133815147%3Fapp_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F133815147&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F528390174_1280.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"
                    width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
            <p>“John,” the men say together. We see the iPads scrolling through all of the names of artists in the MOMA
                collection whose first name is John: John Baldessari, John Cage, John Lennon, John Waters, and so on.
                Three female performers, also wearing headphones and carrying iPads with scrolling names, pace around
                the circle of men. “Robert,” the men say together, and the names scroll through the Roberts
                alphabetically. The women are silent and keep walking. “David,” the men say together. It soon becomes
                apparent that the artists are sorted by first name, and then ordered by which first name has the most
                works in the collection. Thus, the Johns and Roberts and Davids come first, because they have the most
                works in the collection. But Marys have fewer works, and Mohameds and Camilas are barely in the
                register.</p>
            <p>Several minutes later, after the men say “Michael”, “James”, “George”, “Jean”, “Hans”, “Thomas”,
                “Walter”, “Edward”, “Yan”, “Joseph”, “Martin”, “Mark”, “José”, “Louis”, “Frank”, “Otto”, “Max”,
                “Steven”, “Jack”, “Henry”, “Henri”, “Alfred”, “Alexander”, “Carl”, “Andre”, “Harry”, “Roger” and
                “Pierre”, “Mary” finally gets her due. It’s spoken by the female performers; the first sound they’ve
                made.</p>
            <p>For audience members, the experience starts as one of slight confusion. Why are there men in a circle?
                Why do they randomly speak someone’s name? And what are those women walking around so intently? But
                “Mary” becomes a kind of a-ha moment– the same that researcher Robert Kosara says that data
                visualization is so good at producing– when the highly gendered nature of the collection is revealed.
                From that point on, audience members start to listen differently, eagerly awaiting the next female name.
                It takes more than three minutes for “Mary” to be spoken, and the next female name, “Joan,” doesn’t come
                for a full minute longer. “Barbara” follows immediately after that, and then the men return to reading,
                “Werner”, “Tony”, “Marcel”, “Jonathan”.</p>
            <p>From a data analysis perspective, “A Sort of Joy” consists of simple operations: only counting and
                grouping. The results could easily have been represented by a bar chart or a treemap of first names. But
                rendering the dataset as a time-based experience makes the audience wait and listen. It also runs
                counter to the mantra in information visualization expressed by Ben Shneiderman in the mid-1990s:
                “Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand.”</p>
            <p>Instead, in this data performance, we do not see “the whole picture”. We hear and see and experience each
                data point one at a time. The different gender expressions, body movements, and verbal tones of the
                performers draw our collective attention to the issue of gender in the MoMA collection. We start to
                anticipate when the next female name will arise. We <em>feel</em> the gender differential, rather than
                <em>see</em> it.
            </p>
            <p>This feeling is affect. It comprises the emotions that arise when experiencing the performance and the
                physiological reactions to the sounds and movements made by the performers, as well as the desires and
                drives that result — even if that drive is to walk into another room because the performance is
                disconcerting or just plain long.</p>
            <p>Designing data visceralizations requires a much more holistic conception of the viewer. The viewer isn’t
                just a pair of eyes attached to a brain. They are a whole body– a complex, feeling one. A body located
                in space, with a history and a future. Visceralization can be found in many current projects, even if
                the creators don’t always describe their work in those terms. For example:</p>

            <p>While these projects may seem to be speaking to another part of the brain than your standard histograms
                or network maps, there is something to be learned from the opportunities opened up by visceralizing
                data. In fact, scientists are now proving by experiment what designers and artists have long known
                through practice: activating emotion, leveraging embodiment, and creating novel presentation forms help
                people learn more from data-driven arguments, and remember them more fully.</p>
            <h3 id="61ac"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
            <p>The third principle of Data Feminism is to <em>elevate emotion and embodiment</em>. These are crucial, if
                often undervalued, tools in the data communication toolbox. How did the field of data communication
                arrive at conventions that prioritize rationality, devalue emotion, and completely ignore the non-seeing
                organs in the human body? Who is excluded when only vision is included?</p>
            <p>Any knowledge community inevitably places certain things at the center and casts others out, in the same
                way, that male bodies have been taken as the norm in scientific study and female bodies imagined as a
                deviation from the norm or those abled bodies are the primary design case and disabled bodies are a
                retro-fit, or that rationality has been valued as an authoritative mode of communication and emotion
                cast out. But, following feminist theorist Elizabeth Grosz, what is regarded as “excess” in any given
                system might possibly be the most valuable thing to explore because it tells us the most about what
                <em>and who</em> the system is trying to exclude.
            </p>
            <p>In the case of data visualization, this excess is emotion and affect, embodiment and expression,
                embellishment and decoration. These are the aspects of human experience coded “female,” and thus
                devalued by the logic of our master stereotype. But Periscopic’s gun violence visualization shows how
                visual minimalism can co-exist with emotion for maximum impact. Works like “A Sort of Joy” demonstrate
                that data communication can be visceral — an experience for the whole body.</p>
            <p>Rather than making universal rules and ratios (such as the data-ink ratio), that cast out some aspects of
                human experience in favor of others, our time is better spent working towards a more holistic, and more
                inclusive, ideal. All design fields, including visualization and data communication, are fields of
                possibility. Sociologist Patricia Hill Collins describes an ideal knowledge situation as one in which
                “neither ethics nor emotions are subordinated to reason.” Rebalancing emotion and reason enlarges the
                data communication toolbox, and allows us to focus on what truly matters in a data design process:
                honoring context, gathering attention and taking action in service of rebalancing social and political
                power.</p>
            <p><em>This article was adapted from a </em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism">Data
                    Feminism</a><em>, a book by Catherine D’Ignazio, an assistant professor at MIT, and Lauren Klein, an
                    associate professor at Emory University. These authors explore “a way of thinking about data and its
                    communication that is informed by intersectional feminist thought and action.” Such an approach is
                    vital for storytellers to understand in our data-saturated communications environment, especially as
                    the shift to virtual and augmented environments promises to engulf us in 360 information
                    visualizations that morph according to our own consumption habits. But “data feminism is about more
                    than women. It is about more than gender. Put simply: </em>Data Feminism <em>is a book about power
                    in data science,” they write. What’s more, it’s about “how we can take steps towards a more just and
                    equal world.”</em></p>
