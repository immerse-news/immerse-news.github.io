            <h2 id="8ecf"><strong>Statement on MIT, Media Lab and Epstein From MIT Open Documentary Lab and Co-Creation
                    Studio</strong></h2>
            <p><em>To our colleagues across the field, at the university and beyond,</em></p>
            <p><em>Like many of you, we at the MIT Open Documentary Lab and Co-Creation Studio are closely following the
                    shocking revelations unfolding at our neighbors, the MIT Media Lab, regarding the longstanding and
                    harmful affiliations between MIT, Media Lab, Joi Ito and Jeffrey Epstein. We have received many
                    inquiries about our connection to the Media Lab. For clarification, we are not part of the Media
                    Lab. We, as the Open Doc Lab and the Co-Creation Studio, reside under the department of Comparative
                    Media Studies/Writing which is situated in the School of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. The
                    Media Lab is in the School of Architecture. We have no financial or governance ties with the Media
                    Lab. Nonetheless, we want to address key issues and contexts, with the understanding that
                    investigations continue to reveal new evidence in real-time.</em></p>
            <p>First and foremost, our greatest concern is with the victims and survivors of Epstein’s crimes. We also
                support and respect those who have gone public — often at great personal expense — to expose the web of
                deceit and profits directly connected to these horrific crimes.</p>
            <p>We support a full investigation at MIT and we also insist that these investigations be framed by a deeper
                analysis of the systemic conditions — financial, cultural, social — that cement cultures of harm in the
                technology industry and at academic institutions.</p>
            <p>We must also come to terms with the ways, even if unknowingly, we benefited from these relationships
                while other people suffered. The acceptance <a
                    href="https://onezero.medium.com/facing-the-great-reckoning-head-on-8fe434e10630">speech</a> that
                danah boyd delivered at the Electronic Frontier Foundation is a profound example of the kind of
                self-examination that we all must undertake.</p>
            <p>These revelations are part of larger systemic problems. Our colleague Seth Mnookin, director of the
                Graduate Program in Science Writing, wrote about the problematic relationship between fundraising and
                the academy in this <a
                    href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/09/09/mit-media-lab-joi-ito-epstein-scandal/">article</a>.</p>
            <p>We are heartened by calls for change and community outcries, especially among students, faculty and
                staff. In August, Professor Ethan Zuckerman (Civic Media) <a
                    href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2019/08/20/on-me-and-the-media-lab/">announced he was
                    leaving</a> the Media Lab, followed by the <a
                    href="https://medium.com/@natematias/leaving-the-mit-media-lab-ea3066dfeb21">resignation</a> of
                Visiting Scholar Nathan Matias. Arwa Mboya, a first year graduate student at the Media Lab, <a
                    href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/the-mit-media-lab-controversy-and-getting-back-to-radical-courage-with-media-lab-student-arwa-mboya/">called
                    for Joi Ito’s resignation</a> in MIT’s student newspaper. At a September MIT-wide <a
                    href="https://thetech.com/2019/09/19/faculty-meeting-epstein-ties">faculty meeting</a>, professors
                expressed a multitude of criticisms of MIT and demands for change. Of the demands, one included a call
                for the creation of a formal faculty and student oversight committee to review all funding at the
                institution.</p>
            <p>Importantly, Professor Heather Paxton (Anthropology) and Professor Lisa Parks (Comparative Media
                Studies), read aloud a <a href="https://concernedatmit.weebly.com/">letter</a> written and signed by
                more than 60 senior women faculty that criticized MIT for its inaction, as well as its gender and racial
                inequity. The letter criticized MIT for not only “accepting money but also inviting on campus Jeffrey
                Epstein,”, a “level three (high risk of repeat offense) registered sex offender.” The letter identified
                significant gender and racial inequity amongst faculty (of <strong>1066 </strong>total faculty at MIT,
                only <strong>266</strong> are women, of which <strong>21</strong> are women of color). Associate
                Professor Sasha Costanza-Chock (CMS/W, and an Affiliate of the Open Doc Lab), spoke at the meeting to
                request that MIT find a way to directly support those harmed by Epstein, and to propose that the
                Institute apply any ethical screen that it develops not only to future donors, but also to how it
                invests its $17.44 Billion endowment. Professor Susan Silby (Sociology) at the meeting, criticized what
                she described as the Institute operating like a for-profit organization by balancing profits and
                expenses, promoting “mechanical thinking,” and “devaluing social knowledge and expertise.”</p>
            <p>At the Open Doc Lab and Co-Creation Studio, we are deeply committed to equity, justice and transparency.
                We believe that equitable media practices, including the arts, journalism and documentary, can actively
                re-examine and transform the cultures, economies, hopes and harms of technologies and the social systems
                that have emerged around them. We are committed to doing the work necessary to move towards this equity
                and healing at our institution and in the wider field.</p>
            <p>Finally, we want to ensure that the great work being done at the Media Lab and across MIT, by faculty,
                staff, students and visitors — especially by women, people of color, LGBTQ+ and other historically
                marginalized communities - — can be lifted and supported throughout these investigations and beyond.</p>
            <p>We welcome open discussion, questions and collaboration.</p>
