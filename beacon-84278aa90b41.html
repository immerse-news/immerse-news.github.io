            <p><a href="https://www.marshmallowlaserfeast.com/">Marshmallow Laser Feast</a> is a London-based collective
                making gorgeous interactive installations.The group is headed up by Barney Steel, Ersin Han Ersin, and

            <p>Erin Hawley is the creator, writer, and editor of <a href="https://geekygimp.com/">The Geeky Gimp</a>,
                which focuses on disability in comics, games, and TV shows. Her reflections on how to make games more
                accessible are super relevant to all of us making interactive work: “Society often frames accessibility
                as something abled people do to make the world easier to navigate for disabled folks, whether it’s an
                ambulatory contractor building a ramp at a restaurant, or a hearing employee putting captions on their
                organization’s videos. But the reality is that disabled people are also making their spaces and
                creations accessible to other disabled individuals. This is powerful because we know best the importance
                of having true inclusivity for community spaces, both online, and off.” Follow her on <a

            <p>Paola Antonelli is MoMA’s Senior Curator of Architecture &amp; Design + Director of R&amp;D. Her Twitter
                handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/curiousoctopus">CuriousOctopus</a>, which is fitting considering
                her wide-ranging interests and enthusiasms. “I organize a lot of public programs, and their success is
                really about alchemy and chemistry. We invite people that seem to come from many diverse backgrounds,
                and then realize they are all talking about the same thing — that’s what I love.” Her TED talk on
                acquiring Pac-Man for MoMA is a wonderful watch.</p>

            <h2 id="d908">Eyeo</h2>
            <p><a href="http://eyeofestival.com">Eyeo</a> is a yearly gathering for the creative technology community
                that too many of us in the interactive/immersive storytelling space don’t know about. The Eyeo Festival
                brings together a rich intersection of people doing fascinating things with technology: artists, data
                designers, creative coders, AI explorers, storytellers, researchers, technology, and platform
                developers. The next edition of Eyeo is in June 2019 but tickets are always rather hard to get hold of.
                Luckily, Eyeo has an incredible <a href="https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/channels/moderated">video
                    archive</a> available online so you can dive in right now! Below are just two of the talks from Eyeo
                in 2018 — Hyphen-Labs and Matt Adams from Blast Theory.</p>

            <h2 id="c5e4">Lynette Wallworth</h2>
            <p>Lynette Wallworth is an Australian artist and filmmaker. Recently she has made two critically acclaimed
                VR pieces: <em><a href="http://www.collisionsvr.com/">Collisions</a></em> and<a
                    href="http://www.awavenavr.com/"> </a><em><a href="http://www.awavenavr.com/">Awavena</a></em>.
                Lynette has an incredible body of work to her name, with years of powerful installations behind her, but
                it was her first VR piece, the moving and beautifully made <em>Collisions</em>, that made her known in
                the immersive storytelling space. “<em>Collisions</em> travelled as no other work of mine has managed to
                do. Its impact astonished and uplifted me. I felt my years of work, often undertaken in a vacuum, had
                fitted me exactly for this very moment and this technology.” <em>Awavena</em> is her most recent piece
                and you can learn more about how it was made in this video.</p>
