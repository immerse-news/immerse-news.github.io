            <h3 id="f4f2">On the politics of public spaces, documenting protest movements, and AR as a way of healing
                collective trauma</h3>
            <p>I first met Lara Baladi in 2014, when she started her fellowship at the Open Documentary Lab. She arrived
                from Egypt with<strong> </strong>an extensive, somewhat unwieldy, archive from her participation in the
                Egyptian Revolution in 2011 that she wanted to make accessible. Titled <em><a
                        href="http://tahrirarchives.com/">Vox Populi, Tahrir Archives</a></em><em>, </em>this web-based
                timeline of the revolution and its aftermath is both a transmedia series of artworks and an open-source
                portal into archives related to Tahrir Square and other global social movements. It continues to evolve.
            </p>
            <p>While she was at the lab, Baladi collaborated with another fellow, Halsey Burgund, to make a project
                called <em><a href="http://tahrirarchives.com/events">Invisible Monuments</a></em>, a geo-located
                contributory audioscape. It uses Roundware, an open-source app created by Halsey, that enables people to
                listen to geolocated audio clips seamlessly and contribute their own.</p>
            <p>Baladi and Burgund started in Dewey Square, Boston, the site for Occupy Boston in 2011, the same year as
                the Egyptian revolution. People could walk around the site and, with their cell phones and the Roundware
                app, listen to other’s memories and comments about Boston Occupy or add their own. It is a living
                monument to Occupy Boston and, by extension, to protests around the world.</p>
            <p>As the ODL embarked on an initiative focused on augmenting public spaces and places this past year, I
                remembered this project and decided to sit down with Lara again. Her first public space artwork dates
                back to 2001 when she commissioned Egyptian cinema painters to hand-paint giant billboards and place
                them in strategic spaces in Cairo, including Tahir Square. The billboards, which promoted her gallery
                exhibit, posed provocative questions to viewers, unwittingly making them participants in her show.</p>
            <p>What follows is an edited transcript of our conversation.</p>

            <p><strong>Immerse: Why don’t you start by describing your work in public space?</strong></p>
            <p>Lara Baladi: My most renowned artwork in public space is <em>Borg El Amal</em> — in Arabic, the Tower of
                Hope — which, in 2008–2009, received the Grand prize at the Cairo Contemporary Art Biennale. The tower
                was inspired by the architecture of the slums around Cairo, more commonly known as the ‘Red City.’ With
                a small team of young architects and local workers, we built a three-stories-high tower <em>in
                    situ</em>, in the garden of the Palace of Arts, on the Opera House grounds. This military base in
                the center of Cairo, one of the highest and most expensive pieces of real estate in the city. A couple
                of weeks before the opening, I was asked to cover the growing structure before Mme Mubarak, the wife of
                former President Hosni Mubarak, was coming to inaugurate the film festival. The director of the opera
                was worried she would be shocked by the construction site since this type of architecture represented a
                negative image of Egypt. The Red City at the time constituted 65% of the surface of Cairo.</p>
            <p>When the Biennale opened, the Donkey Symphony, a sound piece composed for the project, played in a loop
                inside the tower. Initially criticized, <em>Borg El Amal</em> generated all sorts of incredibly positive
                responses.</p>
            <p>A few years later, Tahrir Cinema and Radio Tahrir were initiated during the early days of the revolution,
                in the midst of the 2011 uprising. Tahrir Cinema was set up in Tahrir Square using a makeshift screen.
                Overnight, it became a significant space for people to gather and watch videos of testimonies, clips
                from the Arab uprisings and more. Both Tahrir Cinema and Radio Tahrir — one of the first free FM radio
                stations in Egypt — were direct responses to the events unfolding on the ground. These two projects were
                unique in how they emerged spontaneously and grew organically and in how my interactions with the
                public, with the protesters, were unforgettable.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: Is this when you started building the archive?</strong></p>
            <p>LB: I had started collecting data seven months earlier but Tahrir Cinema is when I first curated
                screenings using my nascent archive. This month of nightly projections confirmed to me the importance of
                archiving the revolution. Tahrir Cinema served as a way for people to share and exchange footage of
                various battles and events they had witnessed around Cairo and Egypt. They downloaded their footage onto
                our computers and we uploaded some of our footage to their USBs. The point was to disseminate video
                clips from Suez, Alexandria, Cairo, and other governorates as widely as possible. We offered protesters’
                first-hand accounts and narratives of the revolution, thus countering the mainstream state media
                propaganda.</p>

            <p><strong>Immerse: When you think about the elements of public space, how do you integrate architecture,
                    people, and sounds into your work?</strong></p>
            <p>LB: While the foundations of <em>Borg El Amal</em>, the Tower of Hope, were planted strategically in the
                Opera House grounds, government-run space, it was a direct comment on the state of poverty around the
                city. The work also addressed the way the informal architecture of the Red City had destroyed the flat
                and green landscapes along the Pyramids Road. The Donkey Symphony, playing in the heart of Cairo, echoed
                cars honking, calls to prayer and other soundscapes.</p>
            <p>In 2014, during an art residency at Art Omi (Hudson Valley, NY), I staged the Donkey Symphony in another
                type of tower, an abandoned silo in the middle of the countryside. The piece acquired a whole new
                meaning as it resonated against the rusted walls and merged with the sound of the rain falling on the
                roof. <em>Borg El Amal</em> was a “monument for the poor,” to quote a friend, and the Donkey Symphony is
                at once a cry of despair of the Red City and a cry of hope.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: How did your work evolve after you moved to the US?</strong></p>
            <p>LB: When I arrived at MIT in 2014, as part of the fellowship with the Open Documentary Lab, I began to
                explore new technologies and investigate the state of digital archives. The augmented sound art piece
                that Halsey Burgund and I collaborated on, “Invisible Monument,” was one of my first experiments with
                storytelling using these new digital technologies. Halsey Burgund improved and upgraded the version of
                the Roundware software he had previously developed and I curated the data. People could then listen to
                the augmented narrative and contribute to it by uploading their footage or by recording a voice
                testimony. From there on, my work took a new direction, integrating both analog and digital technologies
                as well as embracing further their relationship to the Internet as an archive, as an art space, and an
                <em>agora</em> (a space for dialogue and encounters).
            </p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: Did Invisible Monument get a lot of audience interaction?</strong></p>
            <p>LB: I had just moved to the US, so I hardly had a network. Occupy Dewey Square had lost its momentum and
                there was a big strike on the day of the opening; most trains were cancelled. Basically, only a few
                people were able to join but in spite of the low attendance, it was technically successful. It inspired
                me to further explore how in the future we could continue to occupy spaces if not physically, at least
                virtually, especially when these spaces are controlled. It was also a great experiment in terms of
                leaving a trace of such a significant political moment as Occupy Boston. Dewey Square was a pilot
                project for thinking of ways of recording history and extending the project to Tahrir Square.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: Can you talk about that a little more? What exactly is your approach to recording
                    history?</strong></p>
            <p>LB: Roundware is a downloadable app available both for Android and iPhone. The footage I curated had been
                recorded in Dewey Square, in Tahrir Square and during other Arab uprisings and protests, including
                Occupy Movements. The sound bites initially produced by mainstream media, by citizens (using camera
                phones), by artists (songs, parodies), and by media activists (testimonies) were mapped out along
                various paths throughout the square. As users walked around with the app on, they could hear sound bites
                according to their geolocation. This first layer of “recorded history” was the foundation on which to
                build more layers, personal accounts, and testimonies, creating over time an “Invisible Monument” and
                tribute to a historical event.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse:</strong> <strong>What does it add to the experience of listening to these histories in
                    this public space in Dewey Square versus in your living room?</strong></p>

            <p>LB: These spaces are very charged with historical moments that a lot of people have experienced and now
                share and remember. While we didn’t have many people come to the opening, those who did had been very
                involved in the Occupy Boston movement. If we return to a place where we have experienced something
                major such as a trauma, our cellular memory is automatically triggered. We remember the trauma and
                therefore we can start the healing process. Spaces with emotional anchors invite us to transcend our
                history, individually and collectively. There is still a lot to be learned as to how new technologies
                can be applied to making therapeutic art.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: How would you define public space?</strong></p>
            <p>LB: Because of everything we are discussing here, the word <em>agora</em> immediately comes to mind.
                <em>Agora</em> is the Greek term for a place of assembly. It’s a place where democracy can grow, where
                artistic, political, and spiritual ideas are shared.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: So it’s not about an actual physical space, because there are places where people can
                    gather but cannot protest?</strong></p>
            <p>LB: Public spaces hardly exist in autocratic regimes. When they do, they are highly controlled, not only
                to avoid the sharing of information and political ideas but also to avoid the physical assembly of
                people, which can lead to protests and marches.</p>
            <p>When the uprising started in Egypt in 2011, Tahrir Square became a place of protest, a space for
                exchanging political views. Tahrir Cinema helped catalyze conversations. It offered a space that was not
                available on that scale before. In the “Tahrir <em>agora</em>,” people of all walks of life found a
                common ground and the possibility to express themselves and hear each one another.</p>

            <p><strong>Immerse: What do you think AR can do best?</strong></p>
            <p>LB: As I was saying earlier, I believe AR can play a big role in collective trauma healing. But I would
                add that augmentation is best used in projects that respond to political constraints, in places where
                freedom of speech and public spaces are limited, and in educational projects aimed at facilitating
                access to knowledge, to archives, and to other data sets.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: That isn’t visible to the authorities.</strong></p>
            <p>LB: The peer-to-peer technologies, the access through various apps, the invisible nature of augmented
                reality projects complicate their surveillance.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: Would you consider your work to be augmenting reality?</strong></p>
            <p>LB: If we think about the words “augmenting reality,” as opposed to AR technology, then, yes, I would say
                that my work, and art in general, augments reality. The process of making art is an act of synergy. It
                implies assembling, connecting, layering, ideas, objects, and data, which together equal more than the
                sum of the individual parts.</p>
