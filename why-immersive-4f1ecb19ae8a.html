                    most of one’s attention, time, or energy” — a quality creators should be striving for? (Photo: <a

            <p>When news outlets started buzzing about Facebook’s new Oculus 2 headset this fall, I mentally blocked out
                the headlines. Whatever you think of Facebook, it is one of the world’s leaders in <a
                    href="https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2020/09/26/facebooks-vr-isnt-about-gaming-its-about-data-surprise-surprise/">psychological
                    profiling, data-mining</a>, and precision-targeted propaganda. And it’s leading the charge toward
                immersive.</p>
            <p>After four years working as an editor of <em>Immerse</em>, I feel that it’s time to ask: Why do so many
                well-intended makers seek to create immersive media? I’m not talking about any specific media platform
                (VR, AR, XR) but the quality of immersiveness itself — <em>immersive</em> in the sense of “digital
                technology or images that actively engage one’s senses and may create an altered mental state”
                (Dictionary.com) or a “deep absorption or immersion in something” (Merriam-Webster).</p>
            <p>By these definitions, a 12-hour anime binge is, arguably, an immersive experience.</p>
            <p>Reclining on the couch so fixated on YouTube that you miss your friend’s calls could be considered
                immersive.</p>
            <p>Scientology is immersive. So is drowning.</p>
            <p>Forgetting one’s surroundings, losing track of physical reality, and escaping into a constructed world —
                are these in themselves a good thing?</p>
            <p>As the parent of a middle schooler during a global pandemic, I can’t help but see a lot of downsides to
                immersive. “Immersive,” for those of us raising humans whose brain parts and wiring aren’t all there yet
                — is easy to confuse with “compulsive” and even “addictive.” Teens are spending hours every day on
                social media, mostly on smartphones and tablets. If small, handheld devices without a lot of high-tech
                sensory outputs are so consuming, what impact would surround-sound headgear, a more robust sensory
                experience, and increasingly personalized, psychologically targeted content have?</p>
            <p>Algorithm-based platforms (not only Facebook but YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and others) are engineered to
                grab and to hold users’ attention, to immerse them in the platform. When these outlets cater to
                inflammatory content, fear-mongering, misinformation, <a

                bug. These platforms don’t <a

                    have a particular political agenda</a> beyond making money. It just so happens that prioritizing
                user engagement and homogeneous user-bases is a profit model that <a

                    communities in Florida against Black Lives Matter</a> (and <a
                    href="https://slate.com/transcripts/amVodFlDdHcwWUJHSEYzVjVBYnRGbTFHWFdoSHRBdzRNRG9hdWZJam0vST0=">scaring
                    them away from voting</a>), and for <a
                    href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-youtube-pulled-these-men-down-a-vortex-of-far-right-hate">promoting
                    white nationalism</a> and violence. The <em>New York Times </em>podcast “Rabbit Hole” documents how
                algorithm-based media platforms lead even normal, healthy adults down filter bubbles toward racial
                extremism, body dysmorphia, anti-science, and all manner of misinformation.</p>
            <p>So, after four years of reading VR stories here, I’d urge our readers to seriously consider this
                question: How are makers of VR, AR, and other emerging forms defining the kind of immersion they wish to
                create — and how can these makers intentionally, proactively, deliberately avoid feeding the dangers?
            </p>
            <p>I’ve attended a number of VR events where journalists bemoan the inaccessibility of headsets and the
                small size of the audience. To those complaints, I mumble to myself, “Thank god.” <em>How much time
                    would teens spend on THAT? </em>Before we let Facebook <a href="https://arvr.google.com/">and
                    Google</a> provide the pipes for enveloping sensory experiences, we need a full-on media ecology
                reboot; we need substantial media reform.</p>

                    type="checkbox" id="10987465763061847427"><span class="marginnote">Produced in 1943 by the US
                    federal government, “Don’t Be a Sucker” was deliberately crafted to avoid the immersive, emotionally
                    manipulative techniques that progressives associated with fascist propaganda.</span></figure>
            <p>Shortly after white supremacists marched in Charlotte in 2017, a short film by the US Department of
                Defense from the 1940s started circulating on social media. The Committee for National Morale, which
                advised President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on media policy, created the film “<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=vGAqYNFQdZ4&amp;app=desktop">Don’t Be a
                    Sucker</a>” as part of an effort to counter Nazi propaganda.</p>
            <p>The task that FDR faced in using media to fight propaganda was, naturally, fraught. One camp of advisors
                saw the effectiveness of the Nazi’s manipulative techniques and wanted to copy them — to fight fire with
                fire. But anthropologist Margaret Mead, along with other progressive thinkers who made up the Committee
                for National Morale, won out with a different approach: they went to lengths to avoid replicating what
                they saw as core tools of authoritarianism and fascism.</p>
            <p>Yes, the government needed a persuasive media strategy, they said. Yes, they needed American unity in
                order to combat the global threat of fascism. But what they did not need — and what they considered
                counter to a humanistic, democratic approach — was “immersive” media. Mead and her colleagues realized
                that while uniting citizens around a cause was urgent, it must not come at the expense of individuality.
                It must continually allow and encourage citizens to pause and reflect.</p>
            <p>As a result, “Don’t Be a Sucker” is minimalist in its approach, even for its time. There is no narration,
                no inspiring or emotional music. Instead, the film very simply captures a conversation between two white
                men talking to each other about things that unite and divide:</p>
            <p>[Man 1]: I’ve heard this kind of [hate talk] before, but I’d never expected to hear it in America…</p>
            <p>[Man 2]: I don’t know. It’s pretty good sense to me. What about you? You are an American, right?</p>
            <p>[Man 1]: I was born in Hungary, but now I’m an American citizen… In this country, we all belong to
                minority groups. I was born in Hungary. You are a Mason. These are minorities. And you belong to other
                minority groups, too. You are a farmer. You have blue eyes. You go to the Methodist Church. You have a
                right to belong to these minorities. It is a precious thing…</p>
            <p>Stanford University historian Fred Turner documented this point in time — and the planning behind this
                campaign — in his pioneering history <em>The Democratic Sound: Multimedia and American Liberalism from
                    World War II to the Psychedelic Sixties</em>. In the book, Turner writes,</p>
            <p>“Abraham Maslow spoke for many when he wrote, “The democratic person . . . tends (in the pure case) to
                respect other human beings in a very basic fashion as different from each other, rather than better or
                worse. He is more willing to allow for their own tastes, goals, and personal autonomy so long as no one
                else is hurt thereby.”</p>
            <p>Mead and her colleagues were channeling Maslow in their approach, reminding viewers of their
                individuality, of their differences, and the need to recognize and experience other points of view.
                Democratic media, Maslow and these thinkers believed, needed to do two things:</p>
            <p>a) Portray and prioritize diversity, by which they meant respect for others’ views and experiences, even
                those you don’t personally agree with or like.</p>
            <p>b) Avoid occupying all of someone’s attention — building in breaks and ensuring audiences remained aware
                of their individuality and their environment… in other words, avoid being immersive.</p>

                    the Museum of Modern Art was hailed as the pinnacle of an immersive exhibit in its time. But, <a
                        href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/23-when-media-was-for-you-and-me">according to
                        historian Fred Turner</a>, the exhibit’s creators aimed for visitors to retain a strong sense of
                    their own identity while feeling the emotional tug of giant photographs: “The people who designed
                    these surrounds were very conscious of making sure that there was physical space between images, so
                    that there was room for a person to recover themselves after engaging with the information, the
                    picture, or the data.” (Photo: <a

            <p>In 1991, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulations_on_children%27s_television_programming_in_the_United_States#Children&#39;s_Television_Act">mandated
                    that children’s television programs</a> build in breaks to provide children opportunities to get up,
                check their surroundings, and stop watching. Such regulations no longer matter, now that the biggest
                content provider of children’s content is YouTube, and the sources of internet content are seemingly
                infinite. It seems quaint to think back to the 1950s, when the major media networks needed to adhere to
                a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine">Fairness Doctrine</a>, requiring that
                opposing points of view on any political controversy receive fair and balanced time.</p>
            <p>VR producers showing at festivals and events can’t help but notice how difficult it is for some
                participants to emotionally self-regulate after emerging from a “successful” production. Sometimes
                they’ll need 15 minutes to sit, decompress, cry. Is this kind of deep involvement with a piece a good
                thing? Can such emotional manipulation be dangerous?</p>
            <p>My guess is that those of you reading would say “yes.” Here in the US, we like to view technology as
                neutral — whether we’re talking about guns, or gene therapy, TV, or VR, we like to believe that the tech
                isn’t itself good or bad, it can simply be put to both good and bad uses. What this line of thought
                fails to recognize is that some people will be able to take more advantage of a tool than others. If VR
                can be used to portray the treacherous path to an abortion clinic it can also be used — and with greater
                funding and resources — to show violent images of unborn fetuses, deepfakes, and other terrifying,
                anxiety-provoking (“engaging”) content.</p>
            <p>The major social media platforms (Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat etc.) provide a model of how this works by
                maximizing users’ attention at all costs: more violence, more anxiety, and more fear means more “user
                engagement,” more target-marketing, more dollars. As activist <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/fadiquran">Fadi Quran</a> of <a href="https://secure.avaaz.org">Avaaz</a>
                <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/20-the-bullys-pulpit">put it</a>, social media is “skewed to
                benefit bullies.”
            </p>
            <p>So, for creators of immersive media, perhaps a little soul-searching is overdue. Artists and producers
                may find it gratifying when a person experiencing their VR or AR exhibit comes out of it shaken, or
                joyous, or emotionally transformed in some way. Why? What is behind that impulse to shape and mold
                others? And what can practitioners learn from those stodgy old antifascists who pressed for a media
                landscape that honors individual differences and autonomy?</p>
