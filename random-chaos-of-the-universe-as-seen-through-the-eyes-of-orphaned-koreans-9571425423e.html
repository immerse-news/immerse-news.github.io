                    aging out, and inter-country adoption from South Korea</span></figure>
            <h3 id="ebe4"><em><strong>The multi-platform depiction of 60+ years of adoption out of South
                        Korea.</strong></em></h3>
            <p>This story starts in the 1950s, during and after the Korean War. At the time, two million infants and
                children had been orphaned or somehow separated from their families of origin: Rounded up from the
                streets, found abandoned in doorways, police stations, and churches. Distributed to orphanages, to live
                side-by-side in rows of sleeping mats, boxes, and cribs.</p>
            <p>It didn’t end there. The steady stream of homeless children continued unabated through the post-war
                decade, the decades of political and social instability, the early growth, the IMF bail-out, and even
                through massive development and international expansion into a global economic force. Still, they were
                abandoned and relinquished into orphanages, with consequences of hunger and poverty, social stigma and
                racial bigotry, broken marriages, and untimely death.</p>
            <p>Out of millions, some 180,000 were plucked from the orphanages and adopted out, primarily to wealthy
                Western countries. Most, however, weren’t chosen for adoption or weren’t eligible, and they “aged out”
                to face the challenges of living in Korea without a family. Others died in the orphanages or on the
                streets.</p>
            <p>The random chaos of the universe. In its fullness.</p>
            <p>This is the story that became an improbable, unconventional, multi-platform documentary art project,
                <em><a href="http://sidebysideproject.com">Side by Side: Out of a South Korean Orphanage and Into the
                        World.</a></em>
            </p>
            <p><strong>58 years ago, I was an orphan in South Korea.</strong></p>
            <p>As a days-old infant abandoned on the streets of Seoul, I was processed through City Hall and placed in
                an orphanage. Six months later, chosen based on nothing more than a photo of me, I became the first son
                of an upper-middle class family of five, living in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado.</p>

                    Seoul orphanage to a Denver suburb, and from Kim Kang to Glenn Morey</span></figure>
            <p>80 of us were on the airplane that took us to America. Hundreds stayed behind. All of which begs a number
                of rather mind-bending questions:</p>
            <p><em>Why me? What happened to the other 80? What happened to the other 180,000 adopted Koreans over 60+
                    years? What happened to the millions who aged out? What would my life be if I had stayed in
                    Korea?</em></p>
            <p><strong>Five years ago, we started filming interviews.</strong></p>
            <p>We started in South Korea, with eleven ROK nationals who had aged out of orphanages. From there, we
                filmed interviews with adopted Koreans in eight U.S. cities coast to coast, then on to Stockholm,
                Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Paris, and Melbourne.</p>
            <p>Over the course of 3 years, 7 countries, 6 languages, and 16 cities, we acquired the first-person
                narratives of 100 orphans and “social orphans” born in South Korea since the 1950s—a diverse
                representation of millions of infants and children who were somehow separated from their families of
                origin, institutionalized in orphanages.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/451/1*AYVYqnNmCFk1jqwPuWTLYA.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="3465461120389386133">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="3465461120389386133"><span class="marginnote">We filmed
                    interviews in 7 countries, 6 languages, and 16 cities.</span></figure>
            <p>We approached every interview in the same way—loosely structured, first-person narrative sessions in
                which subjects told us the stories of their lives. In roughly chronological order, they told us what
                they remembered or what they’d been told about their origins in South Korea. How they were separated
                from their Korean families of origin. How they were adopted or aged out. How they grew up and came of
                age. Who they are today.</p>
            <p>We quickly began to understand the unimaginable disparity of our subjects, contrasting the stories of the
                adopted and the aged-out, the nurtured and the abused, the blessed and the broken, the loved and the
                lost, and the stories that lie between.</p>
            <p>We also realized what our subjects were fully prepared to give us — in the human cost and emotional toll
                of remembering love and loss, in the spontaneous and sometimes searing revelations of the moment. Each
                session became its own filmic experience, captured as subjects drew on and relived repressed memories,
                connected events, finally acknowledged truths, resolution, and reconciliation.</p>
            <p>We could have filmed many, many more interviews, going to a dozen other countries. We stopped at 100.
                It’s not a magic number. It was just a way for us to stop.</p>
            <p><strong>Early on, we became committed to the belief that somehow presenting every</strong><em>
                </em><strong>story we filmed was the most honest project we could create.</strong></p>
            <p>Typically, filmmakers have to make decisions. Those decisions, especially in the editing room, result in
                the filmmaker’s <em>interpretation</em> of the topic, told through a limited number of filmed subjects.
            </p>
            <p>This project deserved a different approach. We wanted to find a way to include the <em>many</em> stories
                required to represent an international and largely unknown <em>subculture</em>, and to allow their
                telling to be exactly as the tellers intended. We also wanted our audiences to be able to immerse
                themselves in this subculture, coming to know it and our storytellers intimately.</p>
            <p><strong>So with that, our documentary became, not a linear film, but a non-linear, highly unconventional,
                    multi-platform art project.</strong></p>
            <p><em>Side by Side</em> initially takes the form of an <a href="http://sidebysideproject.com">online video
                    installation</a>, streaming 100 separate filmed interviews, all of them presented very nearly in
                their entirety, as they were filmed in a single continuous sitting — a total of 21 hours of available
                material. Viewing these stories is very different from viewing a conventional movie. With every
                resurfaced memory, every pause, every revelation, and as every minute goes by, viewers come to
                <em>know</em> these storytellers in unexpected depth. In our minds, this installation is the purest
                expression of the project.
            </p>

                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="5235053705466362535"><span
                    class="marginnote">sidebysideproject.com</span></figure>
            <p>Later, <em>Side by Side</em> will be released as a starkly minimalist, short documentary film, providing
                a more easily digestible view of the adoption side, and well-suited for online video streaming
                platforms, theatrical screening, and limited attention spans. Over the course of just 40 minutes,
                audiences will come to know nine adoptees — in Seattle, Chicago, New York City, Boston, Stockholm,
                Amsterdam, Paris, and Melbourne — as they face revelations about their origins and struggle to make
                sense of their lives.</p>
            <p><em>Side by Side </em>is being built into a curated, 10-screen, video art installation, featuring 10
                short documentaries, each focused on an emergent theme from the interview sessions. As essentially a
                non-linear, immersive guided tour through over 5 hours of film, it is the right presentation for museum
                visitors, and will be placed in art, cultural, community, and educational institutions in the U.S. and
                abroad.</p>
            <p>Related articles and syndicated content will allow for expanded context and understanding of the topic,
                with experts in child and adolescent psychiatry, the psychology of identity, social work, and sociology.
                Lastly, the interview transcripts, along with portraits of each subject, will be adapted into a book —
                allowing more physical tangibility and permanence, in a digital world.</p>
            <p><em>In total, we envision five platforms, with five very different adaptations to fit the characteristics
                    of each venue.</em></p>

            <p><strong>“The danger of a single story.”</strong></p>
            <p>Along the way, we’ve been inspired by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, author of <em>Americanah</em>, among
                numerous other novels and stories. Her views on “the danger of a single story,” compellingly articulated
                in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Ihs241zeg">her 2009 TED Talk</a>, helped immensely in
                shaping the narrative of <em>Side by Side</em>. Perhaps even more importantly, her words gave us faith,
                as we watched this project get bigger and bigger.</p>
            <p>But is multi-platform art even a thing? We have no real idea how people will react to its
                unconventionally large scale and multiple forms. Maybe this is just a good way to portray random chance.
                Maybe it’s the only way.</p>
