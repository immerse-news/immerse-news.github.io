            <h3 id="6180">Is it possible to design a nonviolent metaverse based off open-world combat games?</h3>
            <p>It’s one thing to build a virtual world; it’s another to give a user a set of intuitive tools that will
                let them explore it in full. So far, many forays into metaverse interfaces follow the example set by
                video games. <em>Fortnite</em> demonstrates this quite literally, as it is attempting to expand beyond
                its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game">battle royale mode</a> into general
                entertainment with a template made for combat. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvufun6xer8">The
                    recent demos</a> which Facebook — sorry, <em>Meta</em> — has released for its planned metaverse also
                make the experience resemble playing a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game">MMORPG</a>, but
                to perform everyday functions, such as with school and work.</p>

                    conceptual preview of an entertainment space within the metaverse of Meta (formerly Facebook, Inc).
                    From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvufun6xer8">“The Metaverse and How We’ll Build It
                        Together”</a> by <a

            <p>It makes sense that Meta’s designers would look to the now well-established parameters around navigating
                an avatar through a constructed world. But there’s one glaring issue with following that standard: Many
                of the verbs for interaction in the open-world and online games from which metaverse designers are
                taking their cues are structured primarily around violence. And the problems some games have had with
                breaking out of this format forebode similar problems for the metaverse.</p>
            <p>There are, of course, plenty of popular games that aren’t built around killing. But by and large, they
                are not the games the metaverse is trying to imitate. The people behind Meta don’t look to mobile puzzle
                games for inspiration, for example. Even life sims like <em>Animal Crossing </em>don’t seem to have much
                of an influence (even though the modes of social interaction that series has engendered could arguably
                provide a helpful example for metaverse creators to look to). Based on the glossy graphics of Meta’s
                demos and the wider cultural emphasis on VR and AR, a top priority for these experiences is
                <em>immersion</em>. And that means the cutesy, top-down dollhouse look of <em>Animal Crossing </em>won’t
                do. Metaverse makers are looking to the open world. And most of the games with open-world or otherwise
                immersive experiences have built them as playgrounds for violence.

            <p>This paradigm already poses ludo-design issues. As video essayist <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usSfgHGEGxQ">Jacob Geller points out</a>, crafting game
                experiences primarily around combat often results in environments that push or outright break the bounds
                of verisimilitude. Hence the <em>Uncharted </em>series is full of crates stacked and spread out in
                configurations that only make sense as playgrounds for gunfights, and <em>Gears of War </em>games are
                labyrinthed with a truly ludicrous number of waist-high barriers. With each successive generation of
                gaming hardware, advancements have often prized “realism” above all else — more lifelike graphics, more
                levels of interaction between player and world. While designers have gotten better at hiding the seams
                in level design or the invisible walls that herd a player along their designated path, they often still
                struggle with making it feel as though these stories take place in lived-in worlds, rather than in
                spaces designed entirely for the player.</p>
            <p>Within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)">AAA gaming</a>, attempts at
                crafting nonviolent experiences often live alongside the default of violence. Take any role-playing game
                — <em>Fallout, Dragon Age, Mass Effect,</em> etc. — in which fights can sometimes be avoided through the
                proper use of dialogue. Some have admirably complex text trees that can make talking one’s way out of a
                confrontation just as challenging and satisfying as fighting it out. Yet a failure of dialogue will
                simply cause the scenario to revert to punching or shooting. Rare is the sequence in which one <em>has
                </em>to solve things nonviolently.</p>

            <p>Popular director Hideo Kojima has done more work than many to make nonviolent approaches just as robust
                systems of interaction as violent ones in his games, primarily the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> series. His
                stories try to emphasize the moral weight of killing. In <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater,</em> one
                late-game sequence will confront the player with the ghost of every single person they’ve killed. Yet
                the nonviolent systems these games present are often simple substitutions — tranquilizer guns instead of
                lethal ones, for instance. This is especially blatant in Kojima’s most recent title, 2019’s <em>Death
                    Stranding. </em>An anti-killing ethos is built into the very concept of the story. Dead human bodies
                will rapidly cause a cataclysmic rift in space-time, and so if you kill anyone in the game it will
                forever taint a small region of the map. Yet the many non-lethal possibilities for play (crafting stun
                bombs, bolos, even machine guns that fire rubber bullets) are still quite brutal, and look and feel
                almost exactly like the “real” alternatives. I winced when I accidentally ran down an enemy with a
                truck, only to discover that the game was pretty forgiving in the amount of bodily harm I could dish
                out; I guess that poor sap “only” ended up in traction.</p>

            <p>Many commentators have played with the absurdity of these situations through comedic creations. “<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqEGdSEOAis">Peacecraft</a>,” a YouTube series by Polygon
                co-founder and popular podcaster Griffin McElroy, follows his attempt to navigate <em>World of Warcraft
                </em>without engaging in any combat. The premise gets more challenging (and funnier) as he ventures into
                areas of the game with higher-leveled monsters and hostile players. What do you get out of <em>WoW</em>
                if you aren’t grinding for experience points? Within the parameters of the game’s raiding mission loop,
                many<em> </em>players have <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7br694vk">forged complex and
                    meaningful social interactions</a>. But McElroy’s antics demonstrate how difficult it can be to do
                things as basic as leveling up and earning money without fighting.</p>

            <p><em>Fortnite, </em>the current titan of online shooters, has run into a similar issue with its attempts
                to become an all-purpose entertainment platform. This has worked somewhat with <a
                    href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-47116429">its incorporation of concerts</a> (at least
                during the lengthy COVID-19 quarantine), but the custom-built “entertainment experiences” are having
                trouble catching on. Look no further than <a
                    href="https://hyperallergic.com/674333/fortnite-turns-martin-luther-king-jr-dream-into-a-sci-fi-nightmare/">the
                    woefully misguided “March Through Time” event</a>, which let players explore a replica of the
                National Mall during the 1963 March on Washington. There’s a lot of theoretical possibilities in
                crafting educational immersive experiences, but the run-and-gun control scheme of <em>Fortnite</em> was
                a poor fit for it. Users would awkwardly stand around and watch videos of Martin Luther King Jr.’s
                speech, pursue overly literal actions in tribute to his words (such as climbing to an actual in-game
                mountaintop), or <a
                    href="https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/15011/fortnite-disables-emotes-in-mlk-exhibit-whipcrack-emote">perform
                    grossly inappropriate emotes</a>.</p>
            <p>In contrast, a highly violent franchise pulled off a similar idea much more successfully with
                comparatively little effort. Recent entries in the <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>series, each of which
                recreates a specific historical milieu (Ptolemaic Egypt, Viking-age Scandinavia, etc.) have incorporated
                a “<a
                    href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17033024/assassins-creed-origins-discovery-tour-educational-mode-release">Discovery
                    Mode</a>.” In this feature, combat is deactivated, and a player can simply explore the meticulous
                renderings of these places. In doing so, the developers inadvertently spotlight how often a focus on
                violence can obscure the vast amount of work they put into building these environments.</p>

            <p>While publishers’ attempts to retrofit their tools for educational ends often come up short, outsiders
                can subvert these tools for much greater educational effect. Academics and experimenters have found
                their own ways of drawing out the contradictions of spaces designed for violence. Grayson Earle examines
                how the fact that <em><a href="https://immerse.news/screen-tactics-ec0846d44996">Grand Theft
                        Auto</a></em><a href="https://immerse.news/screen-tactics-ec0846d44996">’s police NPCs will
                    never fight each other</a>, no matter how one tinkers with the code, unwittingly demonstrates the
                real-world “blue wall of silence” and inter-cop solidarity. Similarly, the “pseudo-Marxist media
                guerrilla” collective <a href="https://totalrefusal.com/home/operation-jane-walk">Total Refusal</a> uses
                various AAA titles as spaces from which to perform lectures on contemporary issues. They’ve mastered an
                impressive level of cooperation to organically tour these games, often while networked and in <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=P.V.P">PvP</a> mode, while speaking to an
                audience. It’s like a Let’s Play video crossed with a conference talk. <em><a
                        href="https://vimeo.com/301933682">Operation Jane Walk</a></em> uses <em>Tom Clancy’s The
                    Division</em> to look at urban architecture and design. <em><a
                        href="https://vimeo.com/533455589">How to Disappear</a></em><em> </em>is an antiwar movie that
                plays out within <em>Battlefield V, </em>testing how far a player can “desert” a firefight within its
                maps while illuminating the history of desertion in warfare.</p>
            <p>There is one nonviolent aspect that AAA games pull off with relative ease. At this point it is almost
                <em>de rigueur</em> for games, especially open-world titles, to include <a
                    href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-video-game-photo-modes-capture-the-perfect-in-game-picture">some
                    kind of photo mode</a>. It doesn’t take much programming effort to swap out one definition of the
                word “shoot” for another, and it dovetails nicely both with designers’ desire to show off the intricate
                spaces they’ve created and with players’ desire to share their experiences on social media. Certain
                games will even let your player character pose for the pictures you take, breaching the fourth wall but
                making for a memorable image. Some titles even have a diegetic reason for their photography mechanics,
                like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, </em>in which the all-important “Sheikah Slate”
                (basically a fantasy smartphone) has a camera rune (an app). Perhaps in the act of sharing or simply
                capturing striking moments for their own sense of posterity, players can be taught more to appreciate
                game worlds as places in which characters live, and not just playgrounds for their own amusement.

            <p>These different experiments with story and game form all point to a consistent problem with the
                established vocabulary of interactive storytelling design. The field of independent gaming has produced
                exciting and imaginative works that play with, subvert, or wholly discard these precedents, but they are
                not where the designers of the metaverse are looking for guidance. And so these planners of the future
                face the same problems that AAA games have. What happens when a violent framework is applied to
                nonviolent modes of conversation, education, and more? Remember, if the metaverse expands as many
                visionaries hope it will, then eventually “more” will mean <em>everything</em>.</p>
