            <h3 id="a2c4">Collective Wisdom in a time of Covid-19 crisis</h3>
            <p>We are witnessing unprecedented collective efforts to contain a global pandemic. From hyper-local efforts
                to global collaborations, co-creation has never been more relevant and urgent, and powered by the web.
            </p>
            <p>Networks are strengthening, new groups are forming, and silos are collapsing as interdisciplinary
                approaches transcend borders and distances in the geography of virus-containment.</p>
            <p>At the Co-Creation Studio, we’ve been tracking phenomenal efforts to co-create media responses to
                Covid-19 (we published the first-ever field study on media co-creation called <em><a
                        href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/collectivewisdom">Collective Wisdom</a></em><em> </em>last
                year). We are seeing movements emerge at three crucial scales, all of which depend on co-creative
                strategies: People are connecting with direct neighbours on a hyper-local level, (re)organizing
                labour/economy/distribution on national scales, and new types of teams are working globally to cross
                borders and disciplines to accelerate research and public trust.</p>

            <h3 id="fef0"><strong>Hyperlocal: street-by-street</strong></h3>
            <p>On my street, we’ve followed this <a
                    href="https://coronavirus-support-group.co.uk/?fbclid=IwAR0xtAs1_ga7SKAQ_dHNWzo4oES8uycSpm492AdTlcIW6B8i61hFa7zBdCw">street-by-street
                    model from the UK</a> to reach out in analog ways to our neighbours and to organize ourselves
                through Facebook, WhatsApp, and email. It’s a simple principle: to use analog media to make sure we
                connect with those most vulnerable, who are less likely to be on social media. Physical letters are a
                great way to make sure no one gets left behind. We photocopied 130+ personalized letters, and
                distributed them to every household on our street. We asked them to fill out a questionnaire: can they
                help, do they need help, what can they offer, what is their contact info. We are now working through
                privacy issues, and how to organize next, especially when the pandemic hits our community hard in the
                coming weeks.</p>
            <h3 id="b3e9"><strong>Labour (re)organizing in media-making on national and continental scales</strong></h3>
            <p>On national scales, public media organizations are pivoting in phenomenal ways to reinvigorate their
                mandates. <a
                    href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/bbc-keeping-nation-informed-educated-entertained?fbclid=IwAR0E7AFrcl0tq-xqkxc12ATzfFH9x-5Ek3TKLrysEw-6-5ggi6dzwtNSUpw">BBC</a>
                has come out strong, confirming they will use all channels to inform, educate and entertain during the
                pandemic. <a

            <h3 id="6292"><strong>Global co-creation</strong></h3>
            <p>And on a global scale, co-creation is exploding in scientific research, where conventional systems of
                limited authorship often limit collaboration. We are witnessing never-seen-before levels of co-creation:
                groups of <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/science/coronavirus-treatment.html?action=click&amp;module=Top+Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;fbclid=IwAR1vrKZeHyU_9upZD7m83OHKF7J9HrlQYEvNzif5xFCN6ZkEMeurmQNrrVA">*hundreds*
                    of researchers</a> joining forces, working at breakneck speed to come up with treatment and
                vaccines. In another instance, highly responsive research teams in <a
                    href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">Senegal</a> are working with manufacturers in the UK to
                deliver cheap tests.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, #covtech is a crowdsourced hashtag on twitter to organize the independent tech sector
                responding to the pandemic.</p>
            <p>And to battle the spread of disinformation, <a href="https://thetrustproject.org/">THE TRUST PROJECT</a>
                is an international consortium of news companies that’s developing transparency standards to help
                audiences easily assess the quality and credibility of journalism. At the scale of <a
                    href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/">The Panama Papers</a>, this group is
                becoming an invaluable resource in the time of a pandemic.</p>
            <h2 id="79d3"><strong>Why co-create now?</strong></h2>
            <p>In <em><a href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/collectivewisdom">Collective Wisdom</a></em>, the studio’s
                field study on co-creation, we found that the top reasons people co-create include are to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Navigate uncharted territories;</strong></li>
                <li><strong>confront power systems</strong> that perpetuate inequality, and offer alternative, open,
                    equitable, and just models of decision-making that are rooted in social movements;</li>
                <li><strong>tackle complex problems</strong>, especially climate crisis in the epoch of the
                    Anthropocene, with the commitment to finding solutions at the local level;</li>
                <li><strong>deal with time differently</strong>, and recalibrate our sense of time, by insisting on
                    responsiveness but at the same time expanding the timeframe of consequences;</li>
                <li><strong>redefine concepts of the public good, civic trust, and the commons,</strong> including our
                    public spaces, cities<strong>,</strong> platforms, and narratives.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Never before has this sense of urgency to co-create been so evident as we fight a pandemic, and growing
                inequality on our streets, across our countries and around the globe.</p>
