            <p>Sundance’s New Frontier is a stimulating space to explore how artists and technologists are collaborating
                to create novel narrative forms. From virtual reality to mixed reality combined with artificial
                intelligence developments, these immersive media makers are not only experimenting with the future of
                storytelling but testing new embodied spatial interfaces beyond our 2D black mirrored screens. As VR
                pioneer Nonny de la Peña pointed out in a panel discussion, “If the world is not flat, then why should
                media be?”</p>
            <p>In the pursuit of bringing media closer to a lived world experience, the body becomes a central space of
                exploration. The projects <em>Interlooped</em> and <em>Mica</em> are particularly interesting to
                understand the emergence of hybrid spaces where human bodies are digitally rendered inside 3D virtual
                worlds and artificial intelligences are virtually embodied in the physical world, respectively. These
                “dynamics of the biodigital looping” — as New Frontier’s chief curator Shari Frilot described the
                program — open new interrogations of these extensions of reality.</p>
            <p>Combining VR and live performance, <em>Interlooped</em> takes the viewers on a journey towards the
                limitless digital reproduction of themselves. This 7-minute experience created by artist <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/maria_gucci/">Maria Guta</a> in collaboration with tech company
                Imverse is simple but uncanny, playing more with perception than storytelling. Participants put on a VR
                headset and enter a black space, encountering a virtual rendering of <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/maria_gucci/">María</a> as well as their own bodies, 3D-captured in
                real time inside the virtual space. As the music changes, so does Maria, with whom the user interacts
                mainly by dancing. Soon enough, Maria calls out the participant’s name, suggesting that the artist is
                not only virtually there but is also being captured in real time and sharing the physical exhibit space.
                At that point, the time loop starts. By touching a glowing floating ball, viewers go back in time to see
                multiple copies of themselves from the past few minutes, creating an out-of-body experience that blurs
                the distinctions between the original bodies and its copies.</p>
            <p>To generate this experience, Imverse developed a volumetric capture system based on voxels (volumetric
                pixels). Cameras with depth sensors are connected to software that translates bodies into voxels,
                rendering 3D digital replicas in real time. Although the voxel resolution is not completely realistic,
                the low-resolution aesthetic was used to bring the interface to the front as an active agent in the
                construction of the piece’s algorithmically reproduced identities.</p>

            <p>Instead of transferring human bodies into a digital space, Magic Leap’s flagship project <em>Mica</em>
                brings an in-progress AI into the material world through the use of mixed reality (MR), a technology
                characterized by the placement of holograms that are responsive to their environment. Mica is a blond,
                short-haired, white, female-gendered digital hologram powered by the recently launched Magic Leap MR
                headset. What is impressive about this headset is the quality of the holograms and the built-in sensors
                to capture the user’s body and surrounding spatial information. This device includes computer vision
                that not only tracks the elements in the space but also the user’s eye movements, gestures, and speech.
            </p>
            <p>The setting of <em>Mica</em> at Sundance conjured cyborg feminism and surrealism. Inspired by Marina
                Abramovic’s <em>The Artist is Present</em>, the AI hologram was set in a room, seated at a table waiting
                for the viewer to put on the headset and start the interaction. For now, Mica can only communicate
                through nonverbal actions, but her gestures are pretty impressive (although a bit exaggerated). In
                contrast to an AI assistant like Siri or Alexa, Mica does not follow orders and even gives the
                participant directions, such as putting a white canvas on the wall. When complete, a holographic
                representation of René Magritte’s painting <em>The Treachery of Images</em> (<em>Ceci N’Est Pas Un
                    Pipe</em>) appears. Mica stands up and takes the pipe away from it, a sign that we are entering a
                post-representational sphere where reality is continuously shaped by digital non-human interactions.</p>
            <p>There was something at odds about Mica’s cyborg feminist narrative beyond the fact that she reproduced
                the standard contemporary cyborg figure, recognizable from characters in <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> and
                <em>Ex Machina</em>. (This in itself raises critical questions such as: What should AI look like? Should
                it be human-like? Why is it regularly depicted as white and female?) But what was even more troubling
                (and opaque) was that at the backend of the experience a data collection system was operating to feed
                this work-in-progress AI with information from the participants’ bodies.
            </p>
            <p>“Magic Leap will collect certain data about you, including the size and position of your pupils and iris…
                We will extract geometric representations of your face and body movements from the audio and visual
                recordings… Magic Leap and its service providers will only use the information to develop and improve
                Magic Leap’s products and services,” read part of the release form that participants had to sign. That
                makes you wonder if the user’s data is the actual product of this experience (as it is with Facebook and
                other platforms). In this case, it is not so much about the ghosts in the machine. Rather, it’s about
                how in this age of biometrics, big data, and surveillance, we should be concerned with our bodies
                entering the machines. How we are being digitized, datafied, commodified?</p>
            <p>Both <em>Interlooped</em> and <em>Mica</em> raise questions about how our bodies are entering and exiting
                virtual spaces. New Frontier is a good space to have critical conversations on these developments as it
                brings together people with different backgrounds shaping not only the future of storytelling but of our
                lives. As Kamal Sinclair, director of New Frontier Lab Programs (and a contributing editor for
                <em>Immerse)</em>, said at one of the panel discussions, “We have the opportunity to change the course
                of the technology now because it does not have a defined language yet.” But we need to be seriously
                thinking about the sociopolitical and ethical consequences of the making of a new reality.
