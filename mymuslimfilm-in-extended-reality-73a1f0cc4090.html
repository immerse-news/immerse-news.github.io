            <p>For the past month, the US documentary filmmaking industry has been roiled by the selection and premiere
                of <em>Jihad Rehab</em> within the 2022 Sundance US Documentary Competition. The film has been roundly
                criticized in op-eds written by Muslim and MENA [Middle Eastern and North African] documentary
                filmmakers, including Just Films Co-Creative Journalism fellow at MIT Open Doc Lab<a

            <p>Since the film’s virtual premiere in late January, the film’s disregard for its participants’ safety, its

                    despite years</a> of concerns brought up by a diverse group of filmmakers have rippled outwards. As
                a result, two senior Sundance Institute staff have resigned and its top executives wrote an<a

                    Additional coverage</a> from Indiewire’s Eric Kohn traces the controversy’s fallout.</p>
            <p>In the middle of this industry reckoning, contributors to the Twitter tag<a
                    href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MyMuslimFilm&amp;f=live"> #mymuslimfilm</a> have been
                gathering hundreds of works made by and for Muslim and MENA filmmakers and their communities. As
                Boundaoui wrote, a diverse group of filmmakers, “including Black Muslim women, queer South Asian men and
                Arab Christians,” have been using the hashtag to share “an incredible array of stories they’ve directed”
                or admire. Given the close ties between documentary filmmakers and artists working in immersive and new
                media, we hope to bring attention to these 11 makers who have been trailblazing and driving our field of
                extended reality (XR) forward.</p>

            <p>What’s exciting about XR is that (for now) the form and rules are less entrenched than for flat
                documentaries, so it’s a sandbox of experimentation. There is more possibility for writing new
                languages, reconstituting old ones, and building power from within previously overlooked communities.
                We’ll be spotlighting each maker via <em>Immerse</em>’s social media channels and encourage your
                contributions to the hashtag.</p>

                communities in Chicago, which seeks to build power, compel government transparency and co-create new
