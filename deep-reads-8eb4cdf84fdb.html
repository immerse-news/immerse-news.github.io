            <p>Who gets to make and engage with emerging forms of media—and why does this matter? In this issue,
                <em>Immerse </em>Founding Producer Ingrid Kopp <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/who-is-vr-for-20b3f077a912">reflects on these questions</a>. Below, find
                resources on how these questions are being considered in related fields:

                        Center</a>, men are still dominating media across most platforms: TV, newspapers, online and
                    wires. “Too many male CEOs, producers and editors remain in their comfort zones and default to
                    hiring and promoting those who are like them,” writes WMC president Julie Burton.</li>
                <li>Why are we still talking about diversity? That’s the question addressed in a <a
                        href="http://diversity.rrj.ca/">March 2016 package</a> produced by the <em>Ryerson Review of
                        Journalism</em>. “Journalists exist to explain the world to the world — a world of almost
                    infinite variety,” writes Igor Shapiro. “If journalists approach their task with an expectation that
                    people are or should be alike, there’s no chance of the job being done well.”</li>
            </ul>

                        the data</a>, writes Sabrina Hersi Issa, reporting on her ongoing research for the Geraldine R.
                    Dodge Foundation exploring how funders can support inclusive journalism. As mainstream journalism
                    has suffered from a series of financial crises, previous methods for tracking diversity across the
                    industry have fallen apart. Simply “valuing” inclusion is not enough, Issa suggests—infrastructure
                    needs to be put in place to track and assess who’s hired and who leads. “Building inclusive, diverse
                    cultures requires investment of both time and resources and this is what infrastructure reinforces,”
                    she writes. <a

                <li>Tracking who’s creating media is only part of the puzzle, though. The <a
                        href="http://www.jeriproject.org/jeris-theory/">JeRI project</a> tracks the demographics of
                    sources, and how sources’ remarks are weighted in particular stories. “JeRI posits that a real-time,
                    constant quantification and analysis of the types of sources that journalists use tells a story in
                    itself. About whose stories are usually preferred, about whose stories are often missing.”</li>

                    racism and other forms of discrimination are being built into the machine-learning algorithms that
                    underlie the technology behind many ‘intelligent’ systems that shape how we are categorized and
                    advertised to. …Histories of discrimination can live on in digital platforms, and if they go
                    unquestioned, they become part of the logic of everyday algorithmic systems.”</li>
