            <p>As a documentary filmmaker, as well as a researcher at MIT’s Open Documentary Lab, I am both curious and
                enthusiastic about the creative possibilities of nonfiction transmedia projects such as <em><a
                        href="http://www.notesonblindness.co.uk/">Notes on Blindness</a></em>, which chronicles the
                experience of going blind in a short film distributed online, a feature film, and a series of VR
                experiences. In the lab’s Docubase, I’ve curated a playlist of other <a
                    href="http://docubase.mit.edu/playlist/transmedia-101/">notable nonfiction transmedia projects</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Transmedia approaches offer creators the ability to move a narrative beyond the traditional three-act
                structure often demanded by funders, explore different subjectivities, engage a community in an ongoing
                conversation, and tell stories in innovative ways.</p>
            <p>Creating connected stories across multiple platforms also<em> </em>magnifies the vast potential of
                nonfiction worldbuilding. While worldbuilding usually refers to the practice of creating expansive,
                detailed fictional universes for science fiction or fantasy works, it is also a constructive lens
                through which to view and explore the narrative structure of transmedia projects. Nonfiction
                worldbuilders can also experiment with new modes of participation, share more of their stories, and more
                fully understand the “worlds” comprising creators, subjects, and audiences.</p>
            <p>Some of this potential is reflected in work currently being produced by documentary and legacy media
                institutions. Driven by a desire to expand audiences in an age of media fragmentation, and to reach
                younger audiences in particular, media organizations such asPBS, the NFB, and <em>The New York
                    Times</em> are eagerly producing nonfiction transmedia projects. For example, Frontline’s <em><a
                        href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/announcement/frontline-releases-ebola-outbreak-a-virtual-journey-on-facebook-360/">Ebola
                        Outbreak</a></em><em> </em>included a broadcast program, a VR documentary, and short web videos
                created in collaboration with <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>

            <p>Transmedia approaches also feature heavily in “impact” strategy and assessment, now a critical factor in
                documentary funding. These motivations, in addition to brand-building and innovation rhetoric, are
                making broadcasters and networks major drivers of transmedia projects; increasingly, filmmakers are
                required to deliver digital components along with their films.</p>
            <p>On the surface, this push for creative approaches to documentary is a positive development that goes
                unmentioned by Andrea Phillips. Many compelling and innovative projects have emerged from this seemingly
                robust arena of transmedia creation. However, in my research for MIT’s Open Doc Lab, I’ve encountered a
                great deal of uncertainty among producers, creators, and other industry stakeholders when it comes to
                transmedia. The challenges of producing transmedia are substantial: creators are required to navigate
                divergent production processes, constituencies, funding and distribution models, and temporalities
                across different industries.</p>
            <p>On a larger scale, there is substantial confusion around the motivation for creating transmedia works in
                the first place. Institutions’ focus on transmedia is largely driven by vague economic imperatives, as
                well as impact rhetoric that many agree is overly simplistic. While legacy media institutions are
                publicly sanguine about transmedia projects’ ability to reach larger and younger audiences, it’s unclear
                how to best measure their reach and effectiveness: many creators are unsure about who the audiences
                actually are for these projects, as well as what kinds of metrics are available or accurate. As Phillips
                points out, reaching audiences in today’s saturated media ecosystem is challenging, and monetization is
                still a problem.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, much of the work being produced fits a restrictive template: a broadcast or feature
                documentary with an accompanying interactive web component or, more frequently now, a VR piece. The
                centralization of transmedia teams around specific media organizations can also result in uniform
                results in terms of aesthetics, narrative structure, or conceptions of audience. Meanwhile, many
                creators used to working in film resent funding imperatives focusing on digital media, and feel
                pressured to master a growing range of tech literacies.</p>
            <p>In short, documentary and legacy media institutions’ current focus on transmedia approaches often
                prioritizes their ability to build markets and audiences, rather than their ability to expand narratives
                or enrich conversations. At the same time, there are exciting storytelling, community building, and
                experiential possibilities that are being neglected.</p>
            <p>This situation echoes some of the transmedia deflation that Phillips discusses. What is the solution?
                More open and critical discourse around transmedia would be a good start — not only keeping an open mind
                about what nonfiction transmedia looks like, but also sharing both frustrations and solutions in order
                to nurture transmedia literacy and a wider community of practice. Transmedia approaches are a fact of
                today’s media ecosystem, and it would be a shame for both creators and audiences if their creative and
                connective potentials are not fully explored.</p>
