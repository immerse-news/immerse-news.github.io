            <p>Co-creation may not be used for all stages of the media-making journey, especially in long-term, ongoing
                projects. The following diagram, excerpted from the <em>Collective Wisdom</em> report, suggests how
                co-creation sits in the range of a joint discovery process, a parallel track between partners, in which
                no partner is driving—rather, all are co-pilots.</p>

            <p>In our research on co-creation, we learned about how this spectrum plays out in the real world. Hank
                Willis Thomas, a Brooklyn-based conceptual artist, said that one of the biggest challenges of
                co-creation is understanding that partners and relationships come and go, but, in the long view, people
                may also return. Heather Croall described co-creation broadly as moving from the abstract to the
                specific, from divergent to cohesive systems that require different skills and relationships along the
                way. So, too, Ethan Zuckerman, Director of MIT Media Lab’s Center for Civic Media, described his process
                as iterative and changing players as the needs require. Co-creation resides on a spectrum and may be
                used only at certain stages of a larger project.</p>
