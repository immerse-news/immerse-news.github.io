            <p><em>Harmke Heezen and Mike Robbins are Berlin-based digital creators and storytellers. In the spring of
                    2017 they conducted a series of interviews with leading female producers, directors, writers and
                    curators around the question of how interactive storytelling—from online to VR and beyond—might be
                    uniquely suited to women’s perspectives, or expressing the “female gaze.” The interviews and writing
                    below are excerpted from the resulting presentation delivered at the 2017 SXSW Experiential
                    Storytelling Track.</em></p>

                the series <em>Transparent</em> and <em>I Love Dick</em>. She points out that artists tend to write and
                make art about themselves: It’s what you know best, it’s your world view, and ultimately it’s what you
                want recognition for.</p>

            <h3 id="3ae6">Who looks at who?</h3>
            <p>Film theorist Laura Mulvey kickstarted the academic debate on gender representation in film in the early
                seventies. She coined the phrase “‘male gaze” in her seminal essay “<a
                    href="https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/1021/Laura%20Mulvey,%20Visual%20Pleasure.pdf">Visual
                    Pleasure and Narrative Cinema</a>,” in which she combined semiotics and Freudian psychoanalysis to
                analyze classic Hollywood films (such as <em><a
                        href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052357/">Vertigo</a></em> and <em><a
                        href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047422/?ref_=nv_sr_1">River of No Return</a></em>).</p>
            <p>Mulvey noticed that in these films the male is mostly the active character, whereas the female remains
                passive. She is the spectacle: What she does herself is not important, her importance lies in what she
                represents to the male protagonist. The woman is presented as an erotic object for the characters within
                the story, and for the audience watching the film. In order to enjoy the film, a female viewer has to
                take on the perspective of a heterosexual man. Although this theory has been much debated and criticized
                since, it sparked a prolific discussion about visual culture that still goes on today.</p>
            <p>As interactive documentary filmmakers, we investigate the notion of the male gaze with the development of
                our project <em>A Field Guide to Male Muses</em>. The project aims to subvert the male gaze — it’s about
                women looking at men. We want to gather and curate stories by people who identify as female, and capture
                how they look at the men in their lives. By doing this, we investigate the environmental and
                sociological clichés we are served, and perhaps even live with every day, begging the question: “What
                does the act of looking give the person who looks?”</p>
            <p>In the process, we’ve been asking ourselves if there is a specific female gaze. How does a woman see the
                world differently from a man? Can we define that? However, a woman is not only a woman — she also has a
                sexuality, an ethnical background, a nationality, and other characteristics that can shape her in all
                kinds of ways. Every individual is a part of several different communities. Everybody’s perspective is
                colored by the circumstances in which they live. We realized it’s not necessarily important to define
                what the gaze is, or bestow a particular gravitas on a particular gaze, but to acknowledge the fact that
                it will be different in a shifting context.</p>
            <h3 id="c1c1">Interactive storytelling: more women-friendly?</h3>
            <p>Laura Mulvey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWAJdj3cPvA">said</a> recently: “In the seventies,
                we thought that by now, there would be 50 percent women filmmakers.” As we know now, this is not exactly
                the case. We looked at the results of research conducted by two major film festivals, Sundance and IDFA,
                regarding their own programming. These numbers are obviously not conclusive for the whole film industry,
                but give an impression of the situation.</p>
            <p>Between 2002 and 2014, only one quarter of the films in Sundance’s American competition was directed by
                women. Films directed by men are more likely to feature male leads, whereas female-directed films were
                more likely to feature female leads. An examination of ocumentary festival IDFA (DocLab, the interactive
                section, is not included in this research) <a
                    href="https://www.idfa.nl/en/article/65865/the-female-gaze">reveals</a> that 33.2 percent of all
                films selected between 2003–2013 were made by female directors. The festival also noticed that when
                their award juries had a male majority, they were more likely to pick male winners.</p>
            <p>What’s the situation in interactive documentary? We looked at two places where interactive documentaries
                are catalogued now, the <a href="https://docubase.mit.edu/">MIT Docubase</a> and the <a
                    href="https://www.doclab.org/">IDFA DocLab</a> website, and simply counted how many projects with
                female directors were listed in the period 2014–2016.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>MIT had 67 projects listed in this period, 44.8 percent of which had female directors.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>IDFA Doclab had 171 projects listed in this period, 49.1 percent of which had female directors.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3 id="e742">The Conversations</h3>
            <p>From this, you could conclude that compared to linear film, interactive documentary is a relatively
                friendly place for women to work. In the conversations below, we decided to discuss this with some
                colleagues whose work we find inspiring, pictured above.</p>
            <p>One thing all of these conversations had in common is that they went beyond the topic of gender diversity
                and into the arena of ethnic, geographic, and socio-economic diversity. It is clear that you can’t just
                focus on the aspect of gender diversity—there is a network of deeply intertwined factors, and all these
                areas need work.</p>
            <p>So… Are women just naturally good at interactive documentary?</p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F214492077&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F214492077&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F630985596_1280.jpg&amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"

            <p>Perhaps generally speaking women are conditioned in a way that works well with non-linear storytelling.
                But to be an active creator, many have to overcome other things they are conditioned to feel, for
                instance, the evil monster of self-doubt that arises from our society’s ingrained gender perceptions.
                How to slay the monster?</p>

            <p>Apparently there are no experts. It’s Ground Zero. This should mean equal opportunities for everyone. But
                if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Where’s the catch?</p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F214493127&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F214493127&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F630986182_1280.jpg&amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"
                    width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
            <p>There are some traps and hurdles we have to watch out for. What can we do to overcome these in the
                future?</p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F214493934&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F214493934&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F630982942_1280.jpg&amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"
                    width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
            <p>Perhaps the key could be for to all learn to speak the language of code. But even if we work with diverse
                teams, will the audience even notice or care? What are the benefits?</p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F214494457&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F214494457&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F645132146_1280.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"
                    width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
            <p>If we consider these conversations as a whole, we don’t see one homogenous vision, rather a diverse array
                of perspectives. But while points of view might differ, they do form a cohesive body of thought.</p>
            <h3 id="288a">Conclusions</h3>
            <p>There are certain things we can all try to do to make this field gender balanced. An obvious one is to
                create more diversity in decision-making positions. Who is distributing money and how? When there is
                real money to be made, the white men come in. This is why we should strive to keep the internet open for
                everyone and not let it be dominated by the wealthy.</p>
            <p>Barriers between tech and creative should be kicked down. Many film directors are looking for tech nerds
                (who are traditionally predominantly male) to execute their ideas. And on the other hand, coders may not
                always be aware of their creative skills. Not everyone needs to know code, but programmers and
                storytellers should break down the walls between the disciplines and adopt a holistic approach. To
                achieve this in the future, everyone should be offered the opportunity to code and work with technology
                more from a young age.</p>
            <p>Everybody needs a role model, somebody from a community they identify with, to prove that it’s possible
                to do the same. If you are from a community that is not traditionally at the top of the food chain, be a
                role model to others like you and help them get there, too.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, a diversity of perspectives is not just something we should strive for because it’s fair and
                morally right, but also because our field depends on it. As MIT’s Sarah Wolozin said: “If documentary is
                about truth, why would we want one truth?”</p>
