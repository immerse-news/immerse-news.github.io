            <p>Stories are a constant in the history of media. They have been told, recorded, and transmitted in image,
                sound, word, and data. And yet most of our ideas about story — about narrative — derive from media with
                a particular set of attributes. Narrative theory has emerged primarily from studies of literature and
                cinema, forms associated with the media of print and film. Both share characteristics of stability
                (fixed word and frame sequence), attribution (there is an author somewhere), and one-to-many
                distribution (identical copies reach a multitude) — all perfect conditions for story-telling as we
                usually define it.</p>

            <p>But what about stories that inhabit “unstable” media forms, or that are collectively created, or that
                exist as unique instances? Are they lesser-narratives or even non-narratives? Are stories limited to
                particular media — or do they pervade human experience and with them a wide array of expressive systems,
                interactive media included?</p>
            <p>This article summarizes the findings of a research project that considers narrative experiences in
                immersive settings, where users can interact with structured worlds. While the project focuses on user
                experiences in various immersive forms (including 360 and real-time capture Virtual Reality, locative
                audio, and an AI story generator) its findings are more broadly relevant to other forms such as
                augmented reality, alternate reality, and video games, and interactive documentaries. These cultural
                forms allow users to find their own way through a constructed environment; they exist as collaborations
                between the user and environment-designer; and in most cases, they yield unique experiences. Their
                affordances couldn’t be more different from those of print and film, which are used to “tell” stories;
                rather than writing them off, can these experiences instead be described as enabling users to “find”
                stories?</p>
            <p>The question matters because it has implications for how we use immersive and interactive media. We can
                of course retrofit them to behave like film, just as the film medium’s pioneers retrofit their medium to
                behave like theater. And while such a move could be an aesthetic or even economic choice, it is useful
                to understand the alternatives, that is, the fuller array of possibilities that media make possible.</p>

            <p>We, researchers from MIT’s Open Documentary Lab aided by researchers from Utrecht University’s Department
                of Media and Culture, carried out this work with audiences at the 2019 International Documentary
                Festival Amsterdam’s DocLab exhibition, which showcases immersive experiences. The research was carried
                out in the context of IDFA’s Immersive Network Research and Development Program. We gathered and
                analyzed several hundred audience responses to nine immersive productions — <em>A Symphony of Noise VR;
                    Bodyless; Common Ground; Lagos at Large; Nerd_Funk; Only Expansion; Reflector; Rozsypne; </em>and
                <em>The Waiting Room VR</em>.
            </p>
            <p>The research considered the intersection of narrative psychology and immersive media forms such as
                virtual reality (VR). It’s fair to ask what one has to do with the other, but the connection is not
                completely strange. For example, VR has been prominently inscribed within the psychological domain of <a
                    href="https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mediatheory/keywords/affect/">affect theory</a>, and widely
                championed as an “empathy machine” and “intimacy engine.” There are good reasons to challenge this view,
                not because of affect theory but because of the mechanistic assumptions about media’s relationship to
                its users, which harken back to the old days of media effects. By contrast, the use of narrative
                psychology with immersive media does not assume mechanistic effects, but rather provides a diagnostic
                instrument for understanding users’ meaning-making strategies — and the varieties of their narrative
                encounters.</p>
            <p>“Meaning-making strategies” and “narrative encounters” cover a lot of ground. In researching this
                project, we wanted to find out how immersive media users organized their experiences. Were their
                encounters coherent or incoherent? If coherent, what forms did they take — story form? and if so, what
                was the nature of the story? Other forms? How did users describe them? We also wanted to find out
                whether and how user-experiences and maker-intentions mapped onto one another: Were the stories that
                makers told the same stories that users experienced? Which did users find more engaging: the stories
                “told” by the maker or those that they “found” themselves? And could we perceive any patterns that
                distinguished users who preferred to be “told” a story from those who preferred to “find” their own, for
                example, users accustomed to fixed media versus those more accustomed to interactive media?</p>
            <p>Before turning to our findings, it is worth situating this project in the wider field of narrative
                studies.</p>
            <p>Notions of narrativity are expanding from a concern with textual structures that characterizes literary
                and film theory, to include a wide range of human experiences. Consider the narrativist strand of
                historiography, where people such as Hayden White consider the narrative construction of reality; or
                narrative psychology, with Dan McAdams’ focus on narrative and coherence and Jerome Bruner’s on
                narrative as a way to contain life experience; or the work of philosopher Paul Ricoeur on narrative as a
                way to harness the “discordant” in life. (<em><a href="https://benjamins.com/catalog/sin.11">Beyond
                        Narrative Coherence</a></em> provides an excellent overview.) All attest to the wide-ranging
                uses of narrative as strategies and frameworks outside of the literary theoretical context. And all
                offer possible ways to think about how users make sense of their experiences in immersive and
                interactive media.</p>
            <p>Our approach was inspired by <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674003668">Jerome
                    Bruner’s work</a>, particularly his technique of asking subjects to “write a story” that the analyst
                could use as a way to discover the subject’s world. Factors such as person (“I” or “you” or “he/she”),
                agency, and voice were as important to Bruner’s analysis as the world depicted and the manner of its
                depiction. Did the subject “witness” a scene, or were they involved as an element of or an actant in the
                scene? We adopted this close-reading approach in order to understand how users experienced particular
                immersive projects. Our questionnaire asked users to describe what happened after they put on the VR
                headset, it asked for basic demographic information, and it sought to ascertain both the user’s level of
                familiarity with these forms and their genre preferences. The survey was carried out in English and
                Dutch since IDFA is an international festival in the Netherlands, and we gave participants a choice of
                writing or speaking their answers.</p>

            <p>The larger research process included assessing the literature on non-fixed story forms and narrative
                experiences; interviewing makers with backgrounds in both linear and non-linear media about their
                notions of stories, story worlds, and design implications; and assessing the immersive and interactive
                installations at IDFA in terms of their narrative framing strategies (such as descriptions, reviews, and
                thematic physical settings).</p>
            <p>Since this is the first deployment of the research method, we intend to learn from the results and refine
                them for subsequent use. For example, the spoken interviews yielded much richer information about the
                users’ experience than did the written questionnaires, but what did this reflect? Self-selection? (Did
                users willing to invest more time speak and users with less time complete the questionnaire)? Or did
                interaction with the interviewer play a role? (All members of the research team were equipped with
                printed questionnaires as well as audio recorders and interview protocols). Or were non-native English
                and non-native Dutch speakers more comfortable speaking than writing? Or was there a performative
                dimension involved (questionnaire completion is private; recorded interviews were in some cases
                semi-public)? Concerns like these require more investigation as we refine our process.</p>
            <p>For these reasons, the study’s findings are necessarily preliminary. But preliminary or not, they are
                also clear in their implications for how we conceive of immersive media, and with them, the relationship
                between the maker and participant. Existing models for this relationship range from directors and
                audiences familiar from film, to collaborative scenarios in which story-world designers and participants
                work together to create narrative experiences.</p>
            <p>If immersive media are to develop from awkward storytelling systems and realize their potential, it will
                require a much better understanding of an expanded repertoire of strategies for narrative engagement —
                the goal of this ongoing research initiative. Narrative, of course, is not the only path for these media
                to follow; but if other time-based media are anything to go by, narrative will play an oversized role in
                their popular manifestations.</p>

                        Waiting Room VR</a></em> (Victoria Mappelbeck)<em>. </em>Most of the projects fit under the
                broad rubric of Virtual Reality (VR), with two exceptions: <em>Only Expansion</em>, an immersive audio
                walk, and <em>Reflector</em>, an artificial intelligence system that edits video in real-time based on
                audience-selected parameters (shot length, color, framing).</p>
            <p>Our method was straightforward: when people completed their experience, we asked them to fill in a short
                questionnaire or, if they preferred, answer a few questions verbally. We gathered basic demographic
                information; the level of familiarity with VR; and any obvious genre preferences. We also asked
                participants to describe their experience as if relating it to a friend — what happened? Each of the
                nine projects had between 35 and 55 respondents, with a total of 310 written and 68 spoken responses.
                Nearly 40% of the respondents indicated that their experiences at IDFA were their first contact with the
                VR medium. Another 30% described themselves as very familiar with the medium and its different systems.
                Gender-identity skewed female (65%) and participants were fairly well distributed across the age
                spectrum.</p>
            <p>Several broad correlations emerged on the periphery of our work that seem worthy of further
                investigation, even if they conformed to stereotypes.</p>
            <p>Participants who identified themselves as new to VR tended to be the most effusive about the sense of
                presence and frequently referred to themselves in action mode (“I flew’, “I discovered’, “I felt like I
                was in the shoes of the characters’). Participants who reported being quite familiar with VR tended to
                describe the projects’ effect in the second and third person but rarely first.</p>
            <p>Certain projects (<em>Bodyless</em>, for example) produced a cluster of comments regarding feelings of
                nausea and dizziness. In our relatively small sample for this project (fifty respondents), 100% of these
                comments came from subjects identified as female (seventeen of thirty-one). Gendered reports of this
                kind for projects outside our sample are persistent and merit investigation.</p>
            <p>Male viewers, particularly those who identified as experienced in the sector, tended to be the most
                critical of projects. Rather than describing their experience as prompted, they often evaluated the
                strengths and weaknesses of projects and techniques, drawing comparisons to other projects. Their mode
                of address tended to be evaluative rather than experiential.</p>

            <h3 id="63dc"><em><strong>Story or no story?</strong></em></h3>
            <p>The VR projects deployed a range of organizational strategies: inviting participants to improvise (<em>A
                    Symphony of Noise VR, Nerd_Funk</em>), to reflect (<em>The</em> <em>Waiting Room VR, Bodyless),</em>
                and to engage in a more-or-less linear trajectory (<em>Common Ground, Lagos at Large, Rozsypne).</em>
            </p>
            <p><em>A Symphony of Noise VR</em>, the most abstract of the projects, elicited descriptions of the process
                and evaluations of the experience (“fun,” “like playing a really beautiful video game”). None of the
                respondents described their encounter in narrative terms. <em>Nerd_Funk</em>, improvisational but also
                more tangible, elicited what might be termed narrative frames: “an XTC trip, all by myself, intense,
                distracted by the telephone, alone, loved it”; and “digital LSD, immersive, grotesque … the way we’re
                going to party in 20 years”. <em>Nerd_Funk</em>’s imagistic vocabulary resonated in particular with
                younger users, one of whom described it in dream-terms: “I think I was holding a phone and liked the
                part where the phone gives a notification. (I was trying to take a selfie with the phone. Curious about
                how I look!)”</p>
            <p><em>The Waiting Room VR</em> was embraced — or rejected — as an <em>experience</em>. Female-identified
                participants — and those who mentioned having friends with cancer — generally embraced it as emotionally
                moving. These descriptions were empathetic rather than sympathetic, sometimes in the first person, with
                participants identifying through the VR character or through their friends. Those who rejected the
                experience as “boring” and “static” generally described the situation (“a woman is getting
                chemotherapy,” “someone is dying”), and dismissed it. Common to both sets of responses was an acceptance
                of the project as an experience (of chemotherapy, of coming to terms) and not as story.
                <em>Bodyless</em>, by contrast, elicited comments about its mechanic — flying, floating — and often
                about the narrative world (“the story of my journey after death,” “in a twilight world between memory
                and fantasy in Taiwanese history,” “a visit to the gateway of hell”). Interpretive latitude was
                extensive, and <em>Bodyless</em> offers a good example of how the framing of a project through
                information and reviews can structure an experience, or be ignored, opening up quite divergent readings.

            <p>Nearly all of the reactions to <em>Rozsypne</em> agreed on basic elements (“sunflowers,” “falling
                bodies,” “an old lady”). However, users experienced them as either witnesses or participants. Using the
                “I” or “you” form, participants described textures and at times expressed a reluctance to explore the
                emotionally charged events. While the story was well-known from the news, the project’s intimacy and the
                freedom it gave users to look or not evoked emotional responses.</p>

            <p><em>Common Ground</em> likewise elicited strong responses, giving users access to the intimate side of
                gentrification. As with <em>Rozsypne</em>, users came to the project with a relatively clear
                understanding of the underlying events, giving greater latitude to their exploration of the world.
                Beyond repeating the project’s informative text, users commented on their closeness (sometimes bordering
                on transgressive) with the Estate’s inhabitants.</p>
            <p><em>Lagos at Large</em> was “like visiting Lagos with a friend,” said one user. Many commented on the
                feeling of “being there,” a feeling complicated by the soundtrack, which evoked quite different
                responses. Much like <em>Nerd_Funk</em>, many users inscribed their experience of Lagos in narrative
                frames (“I wandered the streets,” “a tourist information movie”); but virtually none discussed their
                encounter with the world in narrative terms. <em>Only Expansion</em>, an immersive sound project that
                mixed recorded with amplified live sounds, was described in much the same way. The narrative frame drew
                attention, and the sound mix was assessed; but discussion of the experience itself, as well as any sense
                of story, were generally absent.</p>
            <p>Across the projects, the clearest correlations appeared between relatively inexperienced users and both
                the use of person (beginners say “I” more frequently than others) and the physicality of effect (“I
                flew,” “you rode around Lagos”). For our investigation of narrative, variation among narrative frames
                (what position does the user embody?) was pronounced, even in those examples where the intertextual
                frame was clearly defined (gentrification in <em>Common Ground</em> and the downing of flight MH17 in
                <em>Rozsypne</em>). Interestingly, users of both relatively abstract productions (<em>Nerd_Funk</em>)
                and narratively-structured (<em>Rozsypne</em>) spoke in equal measure about their narrative frames. This
                “framing” is a key variable, both shaping and revealing how users approach an experience. And it seems
                to be a variable that can be controlled through the staging of a project more than through pre-existing
                knowledge.<em> </em>Although <em>Reflector</em> fit poorly into this immersive group, it offered a great
                example of the power of framing: those who read about the experience first seemed to enjoy exploring it,
                and those who didn’t seemed lost. The project represents an important step in personalized story
                generation, and we are exploring it in the context of an ongoing AI project.
            </p>
            <p>Our research instrument needs considerable improvement. Too often, questionnaire respondents “reviewed”
                projects rather than sharing their narrative experience. Audio interviews produced richer data, and for
                the next round, we will focus more on individual and group interviews. We have gathered a number of
                tantalizing correlations in the responses regarding perspective and tense as indicators of agency, and
                are eager to test them with both real-time capture VR and 360 video. And we will drill down on the
                notion of narrative framing as a determinant in “story finding” for the project’s next iteration, trying
                to better understand its role.</p>
