            <p>Abandon Normal Devices describes itself as “a nomadic commissioner and born-digital producer unafraid to
                enter new territories and broker new partnerships.” The company produces the incredible <a
                    href="https://www.andfestival.org.uk/festival/past-festivals/">AND Festival</a>, which moves around
                the UK, mapping different terrains and modes of commissioning and exhibiting work in forests, caves, and
                in the streets. The festival takes place every two years and if you ever get the chance to go, leap at
                it! I’ve never experienced anything quite like it.</p>

            <p>Honor Harger is director of the ArtScience Museum in Singapore. Whether exploring big data, rainforests,
                or artificial intelligence, the ArtScience Museum’s projects are inspired by Leonardo’s motto:
                “Everything is connected.” Originally from New Zealand, Harger was director of Lighthouse in Brighton
                before moving to Singapore to take up her role at the ArtScience Museum. She has also been a guest
                curator of Transmediale, an international festival of art and digital culture in Berlin. From 2004–2008,
                she was the director of the AV Festival, the UK’s largest biennial of media art, film, and music. Her
                curation and practice is interdisciplinary and I recommend following her on <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/honorharger">Twitter</a> if you are interested in the connections between
                art, science, and technology.</p>

            <p>Ian Cheng creates computer-generated simulations like those used in predictive technologies for complex
                scenarios such as climate change or elections. His <em>Emissaries</em> trilogy works like a never-ending
                video game in real time: “It was a process that was on-going as life is on-going.”</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>We need meaning to ground ourselves in a sense of purpose, otherwise we’re just filled with anxiety.
                    On the flip side, we need meaninglessness to interject bald reality into our life scripts, in order
                    to force ourselves to refresh them. So, in the simulations, I’m trying to find a way in which these
                    two forces constantly sculpt each other in a very formal way.</p>
