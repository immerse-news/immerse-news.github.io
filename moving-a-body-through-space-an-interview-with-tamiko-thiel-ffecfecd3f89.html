            <h3 id="8f42">On the guerrilla potential of AR, dramatic arcs, and the politics of visibility</h3>
            <p>In 2010, a group of “uninvited” artists took over MoMA by placing their artwork in its galleries using
                location-based augmented reality (AR). The pieces were only visible to those who knew they existed and
                used the accompanying mobile application. “<a href="http://www.sndrv.nl/moma/">We AR in MoMA</a>” was a
                groundbreaking AR intervention in which the organizers, Mark Skwarek and Sander Veenhof, questioned:
                what is the impact of AR on our public and private spaces? Is the distinction between public and private
                spaces fading, or is reality fragmenting into individual perceptions?</p>
            <p>A year later, <a href="https://tamikothiel.com/">Tamiko Thiel</a>, one of the artists who exhibited at
                “We AR in MoMa,” co-founded an artists group with Skwarek and Veenhof and led their intervention at the
                Venice Biennale. Known as Manifest.AR, they were not only early practitioners of AR but wrote the <a
                    href="http://manifest-ar.art/">augmented art manifesto</a>. The group opened the conversation for
                the value of AR as a form of art.</p>

            <p>A pioneer in both Virtual Reality (VR) and AR, Thiel is an internationally recognized digital media
                artist who explores the interplay of place, space, the body, and cultural identity in works that take
                the form of an AI supercomputer, sculpture, digital prints, videos, interactive 3D virtual worlds, AR,
                and deepfake AI installations <em>in situ </em>in galleries, museums, and public space. In 1994, Thiel
                worked with Steven Spielberg on the pioneering <a
                    href="https://www.tamikothiel.com/starbright/index.html">Starbright World</a>, an online virtual
                world playspace, commissioned by the Starbright Foundation, in which seriously ill children in hospitals
                all over the U.S. met via a network to play together as avatars in the virtual 3D world and discuss
                their concerns via text chat, audio, or video conferencing. Thus, Thiel’s trajectory has been
                characterized by her ability to recognize the value of new approaches to art and storytelling, and to
                chart blueprints for their implementation in the field.</p>
            <p>My research at the Open Documentary Lab (ODL) on augmenting public spaces has been part of a two year
                initiative to explore augmented technologies and techniques used by communities to claim, reclaim, and
                reimagine their public spaces. For instance, AR adds to, through a phone’s camera, the user’s real-life
                experience, whereas VR produces an alternate world in which the player uses special equipment such as
                computers, sensors, headsets, and gloves. I admire how Thiel deploys AR as a way to question
                institutionalized practices of accessibility. AR does not require permission or invitation, nor
                gatekeepers or curators who define whether the art is worthy enough to occupy private or public space.
                Moreover, unlike a physical artwork that is removed after its exhibition, AR artwork remains on site as
                long as the artist wishes; neither institutions nor the government is able to remove it. For Thiel, the
                idea that they could place their art wherever they wanted was liberating.</p>
            <p>After her participation in the ODL panel “<a
                    href="http://opendoclab.mit.edu/presents/layers-place-art-augmenting-public-spaces-places-stories-technologies/">LAYERS
                    OF PLACE</a>: The Art of Augmenting Public Spaces and Places with Stories and Technologies,” I spoke
                with Thiel about her work in AR and VR. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>

                    Absence: Public Voids” augmented reality intervention into the Venice Biennial, Tamiko Thiel,
                    2011.</span></figure>
            <p><strong>Immerse: In a digital world, why do you think physical space still matters?</strong></p>
            <p>Tamiko Thiel: Even the virtual reality installations that I’ve done always include moving a body through
                space. In augmented reality, you have to physically move your body through space to see the entire
                installation. For me, the appropriate receptive and kinesthetic senses of the body are a very important
                part of perceiving and interacting with virtual and augmented space.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: What’s unique about AR compared to VR?</strong></p>
            <p>TT: I spent 15 years working on a total of three virtual reality projects. Working in VR means that you
                spend a lot of time researching the site and reconstructing it, and only then, you can start playing
                around. With AR, I could use an existing site and I didn’t have to spend four years recreating a site
                before I could start playing with it as in my VR artwork. I think the fastest turnaround that I’ve ever
                had was maybe two hours or even less. I was in Lisbon and I was staying a couple of blocks away from the
                square where the Portuguese Carnation Revolution had started. I found a carnation on the internet and
                created a rain of carnations. I installed the piece with GPS at that Square, and it turned out really
                well. And I thought: I can, within a couple of hours, create an artwork that speaks to a deeper history
                of this very specific site. It was incredibly empowering.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: Do you apply your theory of dramatic structure, an experiential viewpoint, to your AR
                    work? Is there any AR project that illustrates the use of sequence to create a dramatic
                    structure?</strong></p>
            <p>TT: With AR, I don’t want to focus on people who have the newest, most expensive smartphones; I want to
                make it more inclusive. Therefore, I’ve always tried to keep my works simple enough so that they can be
                seen by a large number of people, and that has meant keeping the content a little bit reduced. With
                virtual reality, you’re working with so much more computing power, so you can afford to create these
                more complicated dramatic structures, but as the old smartphones become more powerful I hope to do more
                and more of that with augmented reality as well.</p>
            <p>In a piece I’m working on right now together with my co-artist /p, ReWildAR, for the FUTURES exhibit at
                the Smithsonian, I’m creating a wildflower and pollinator insect meadow, and there, I will be setting up
                a sort of a dramatic arc that takes you from early spring to late summer and back again. You have some
                flowers that come out in the early spring and then fade away, so there’s sort of a melody of both
                flowers and their associated pollinators fading in and out. This is the first time that I’ve thought,
                okay, even with low-powered smartphones I should be able to create a certain dramatic arc. It’s a little
                bit of an experiment.</p>

            <p><strong>Immerse: In your VR projects, users play a central role in constructing their own narrative. How
                    do you conceptualize the role of users in your AR projects? What do you think about the user’s
                    agency and accountability, for instance, in </strong><em>Biomer Skelters</em><strong>?</strong></p>
            <p>TT: When you’re playing a game you usually have to try as hard as possible, you have to put out as much
                energy as possible in order to win. In the area of biofeedback, there’s a different mindset. <em>Biomer
                    Skelters</em> was done together with Will Pappenheimer, one of my colleagues from Manifest.AR. We
                spent a lot of time talking with scientists working with biosensors at the Liverpool John Moores
                University. They also talked about ideas like “relaxed to win.” The concept of relaxing to win sounded
                interesting to me, and Will and I came up with the idea of competitively coating the entire city with
                vegetation. Will suggested participants had to choose a “team”: You can be either an Indigenator, who is
                planting indigenous plants, or an Exoticator planting invasive species. It’s an interesting use of terms
                because we often talk about invasive plants taking over from the native plants. If you use the same
                words to talk about humans, however, you get into very difficult realms of racism, colonialism,
                imperialism and alterity. I wanted to bring that into the discussion. We were hoping that somebody would
                pick it up, but the venues said, “no, let’s just talk about plants,” which was too bad.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: Something that I have been puzzled about is the invisibility of AR. If you have
                    invisible art, you might want to heighten its awareness. I’m also intrigued by the recursiveness of
                    AR. For instance, for your piece </strong><em>Unexpected Growth</em><strong>, there was a projector
                    that was displaying what the people were seeing. What are your thoughts about the visibility of
                    AR?</strong></p>
            <p>TT: One of the things that got me interested in AR as a geolocated form is that it doesn’t need a
                physical object, and, therefore you can do it anywhere you want. The very first time that I worked with
                augmented reality was this intervention into the MoMA organized by Mark Skwarek and Sander Veehof, and
                the whole point was that we were not allowed to put our artwork inside; we couldn’t put physical images
                nor objects into MoMA. That’s part of how an institution like MoMA defines the canon of what they allow
                inside their doors. With AR, it was the realization that walls are not an impediment anymore. We can put
                our artwork anywhere, so it was that specific ability that they can be used for guerrilla interventions
                where, otherwise, we would need to spend a lot of time and energy trying to get permission from whatever
                authority controls that space. Or the whole point might be that you know that authority would not
                authorize you to put the artwork there and therefore you are using AR to locate it there, to get around
                exactly that prohibition.</p>

            <p><strong>Immerse: The color gold seems to reoccur in your projects. Why is that?</strong></p>
            <p>TT: There’s a specific technical reason. If you try making AR on a lot of different backgrounds, you’ll
                find that generic backgrounds are white, very dark, or various colors, but usually not gold. And, of
                course, gold has an association with high value and artwork in some sense. So, it’s partially because
                it’s wonderfully visible, no matter the background, and the other part of it is because the gold leaf is
                a statement in itself to say that this is a work of value.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: What’s next for you and your artwork? Are you going to continue working on AR, or are
                    you looking towards other technologies?</strong></p>
            <p>TT: I’ve got several things happening. I am hoping to have a broader art practice in the future. Because
                as much as I love AR and VR, I also love the physical world, I love objects, I love images, and I want
                to be able to produce in a wide range of media.</p>
