            <p>On a breezy March morning I rushed through a little alley in downtown Columbia, Missouri, to a
                post-industrial red brick building with the words “As Mine Exactly” painted on the window. Filmmaker
                Charlie Shackleton welcomed me into a small room bathed in soothing music and dim lights. Two chairs
                stood opposite each other, surrounded by speakers hanging on the walls, grounding me, this performance’s
                single audience member, into a space where intimate secrets would be shared.</p>
            <p>This performance, titled <em>As Mine Exactly </em>(2022)<em>,</em> is the newest addition to Charlie’s
                significant oeuvre of essayistic films. Spanning self-reflexive shorts, video essays, found-footage
                media critiques, and a contribution to the VR anthology <em>A Machine for Viewing </em>(2020), Charlie’s
                work, in addition to this performance, continues to push the bounds of cinema as a technology.</p>
            <p><em>As Mine Exactly </em>emulates a live conversation between Charlie and his mother, Jane Shackleton,
                focusing on the time she began having epileptic seizures, and extends Charlie’s thematic interests into
                the curved screen of a VR headset. Mother and son both speak candidly about their fears and subjective
                experiences of living the episodes versus seeing them. Charlie performs his part of the conversation
                live while Jane’s pre-recorded voice plays from the speakers, situating listeners between them. They
                share fragments of documentation over nearly two decades: family photographs, Charlie’s videos of his
                mom while having seizures, and Jane’s detailed diary notes about how she felt afterwards. Avoiding the
                temptation of making grand conclusions about the particularities of seizures, the pair thrusts its
                audiences into a space of affect, rooted in their own uncertainties across all this time.</p>
            <p><em>As Mine Exactly</em> was first performed as part of the Ctrl+Alt+Shift immersive sidebar of the
                eclectic True/False Film Fest (March 3–6, 2022). The section also included works by Yannick
                Trapman-O’Brien, Victoria Mapplebeck, and <a

                installed in a gallery space. After the festival, I had a longer conversation (edited for length and
                clarity) with Charlie, on his stylistic decisions and philosophical and emotional frameworks around
                ethics, form, and documentary.</p>
            <p><strong>Milton Guillén: </strong><em>As Mine Exactly</em><strong> is an extremely intimate piece that
                    moves away from the so-called empathy machine trope of VR — it doesn’t attempt to dilate time or
                    lean into immersion through 360-degree video. What’s unique about your work is that it’s constrained
                    by subjectivities. How did you handle this material and what were the different stages, across time,
                    that elicited the treatment and care you gave to it?</strong></p>
            <p>Charlie Shackleton: A couple of years ago I started mentally revisiting that period of my childhood, when
                my mom was first diagnosed with epilepsy. I had the version of it in my head that it was this quite
                academic series of events. All the artifacts of that time — the photographs, the videos, but even just
                things that my mom or I had written — were all incredibly emotional to revisit, but also weirdly
                clinical. They were all already stored in a folder that hadn’t been opened for 15 years.</p>
            <p>The more I thought about the experience of that time, both from my perspective as a child and from my
                mom’s perspective as someone experiencing seizures for the first time, I saw a lot of similar
                contradictions. These very intimate moments were nonetheless imbued with a real distance because of our
                difference in perspective and the distance that a seizure forces upon the person experiencing it. By
                fortunate happenstance, I had also been exposed recently to VR for the first time. As intrigued as I was
                by the technology, I felt very skeptical of a lot of the claims, namely the ones you mentioned, that
                were made on its behalf. My bodily experience of VR is not one of immersion; it’s one of dislocation and
                incapacity. Few art forms are defined by two completely opposing forces like that. I’d been thinking
                about the contradictions of this technology at the exact same time that I’d been revisiting this
                childhood material and memory, and finding a lot of the same contradictions. The form of <em>As Mine
                    Exactly</em> came quite organically from these two things.</p>
            <p><strong>MG: I completely identify with this sense of dislocation versus immersion. In this work you bring
                    a multi-modal scripted performance, using desktop documentary techniques within a VR headset, while
                    also performing a script live to a single person at the time. Could you speak a little bit about why
                    you made it this way, in the context of the work’s themes?</strong></p>
            <p>CS: Before it was an artistic project, I talked to a friend about having been a child, having observed my
                mom’s seizures, and ultimately having filmed a number of them for medical observation. This friend
                instantly made the connection between that and me being a documentary filmmaker. My initial reaction
                was, “No, absolutely not. It’s too sensitive to me and it’s too personal.”</p>
            <p>Once I started interrogating that thought, I realized that I found the idea that I could take this
                incredibly intimate material and release it into a content ecosystem in which it can be consumed in any
                number of ways, with any amount of engagement, empathy or a lack thereof, off-putting. For much of the
                work I’ve made, that’s exactly the kind of unpredictable lack of control I want for its artistic
                possibilities. With <em>As Mine Exactly</em>, it felt irresponsible, both to me and my mom and also to a
                viewer, to put something sensitive out into the world with no assurance that it would be received in an
                ethical way.</p>
            <p>That was what led me towards this setup: one person confiding in another who has to commit to something
                not insubstantial, spending 30 minutes in a small room with another person, focused on the story that
                they’re telling you. All of the technologies that are used in the piece (desktop documentary, VR,
                multi-channel sound) are ways of strengthening that bond.</p>
            <p><strong>MG: It did feel like a confession as well as a meditation that created a sense of respect to the
                    process and the story you shared. There are other ethical directions to consider here, such as the
                    collaboration that you have with your mother. How, if so, did the two of you collaborate on the
                    final piece?</strong></p>
            <p>CS: Initially I had real hesitations about making a personal documentary. For one, I worried that it was
                only resonant to me and that I was a bad judge of what would be interesting to other people. I also knew
                that there was no way to make a piece in which me and my mom had equal agency, short of co-directing it.
                Even then, it’s my idea, and it’s me that is setting out to do it, so there’s always going to be an
                imbalance. I began thinking about my ethical responsibilities to her, to accurately reflect her
                perspective, but also to acknowledge my own greater agency within that act of presenting perspectives.
            </p>
            <p>That informed, in large part, the decision for me to perform my narration and half of our conversations
                live in the room with each participant. As much as that might feel like a very over-the-top
                demonstration of artifice, to me, it was really no different than if it had been pre-recorded. I wanted
                at least to demonstrate those relative degrees of agency.</p>
            <p>At the same time, I don’t mean to overstate the imbalance, because at the core we both wanted the same
                thing out of the project. We had many conversations about whether to share this material with anyone
                else, and if so, why and how. I would never present anything in the piece that she was uncomfortable
                with. But I never wanted that label of collaboration to tip over into a denial of the basic differences
                in our roles.</p>
            <p><strong>MG: At the end of the performance you walk away and give the audience member a break, leaving us
                    with our own thoughts. Was this format informed by the emotional weight of the performance or the
                    seriousness of the material?</strong></p>
            <p>CS:<strong> </strong>I worried that ending the piece by leaving the room and letting the participant stay
                there for a few minutes would feel theatrical, like I had disappeared or something. I decided to be very
                practical about it and explain that I was going to do it and what would happen after. I think through
                that lens, it turned into a mutual act of respect. It is a lot to have to take off a headset and
                immediately be confronted by the person who’s just been performing to you for half an hour, so I wanted
                to give them an easy, decompressed way to finish the experience.</p>
            <p>One of the things I like best about when people finally emerge is that they rarely thank me for it. It’s
                much more often a sense that we need one final acknowledgement that we’ve just been through something
                together before we go our separate ways. It really makes the whole thing feel both easier emotionally
                and also like something more important has happened.</p>
