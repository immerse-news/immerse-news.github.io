            <p>Take a breath. Close your eyes. Imagine yourself on a busy street corner as a passerby: cars rushing by,
                vibrating your body from the core of your feet; people in fast motion racing to unknown destinations; a
                screeching siren and blue flashes of light that disturb even your closed eyes. Do you see a mother
                caressing her baby’s arm? A man, texting, trips on cracked sidewalk. Do you hear taxis honking their
                horn loudly, or those two drivers arguing over a parking space? These are layers of memories of a public
                site.</p>
            <p>From July 2018 through October, if you were a passerby on Tremont Street, by the historical city block of
                Boston Center for the Arts (BCA), you would have heard the voices of men singing lullabies from
                treetops, waves of sound moving through your body as you moved through the space.</p>

                    site-responsive public sound installation, Boston Center for the Arts public plaza, July-Oct
                    2018</span></figure>
            <p>If you paused and got closer to sources of the sounds, motion sensors would trigger another layer of
                sound, audio documentaries, fragmented narratives, memories of fathers on federal probation. The soft
                voices, withstanding noise of wind, cars and chatter, demanded your attention and invited you to listen.
            </p>
            <p>This was the first in a series of public sound installations titled <em><a
                        href="https://fatherslullaby.org/">A Father’s Lullaby</a></em>. My hope is to install these in
                many cities in United States—if possible, simultaneously. Every local site will become a place where the
                sounds are collected. I will then work with local artists/composers to create a series of sound
                compositions to be projected at the site. The companion website for the project will offer recordings of
                the sounds on a virtual map. Over the past two years, the project has included two other participatory
                public art installations, including a multimedia installation at Villa Victoria Center for the Arts from
                November-December 2017, and a multimedia installation at HUBweek in October 2018.</p>

                    Demirjian here: <em><a href="https://immerse.news/sound-that-surrounds-9ba93cac5411">Sound That

            <p>Consider the public place as a site of collective experiences and for art to emerge without you knowing
                that it is art. Consider that public art can enable moments of pause, deep thinking, and actions.
                Consider a public site as a critical site to contemplate social issues, to construct new meanings, new
                social memories.</p>
            <p><em><a href="https://fatherslullaby.org/">A Father’s Lullaby</a></em> is part of a larger multi-platform,
                documentary-based project. The project highlights the role of men in raising children and brings
                attention to the absence of fathers in communities of color as a direct result of mass incarceration.
                Incarceration impacts the lives of children who are left behind, weighing on women and lower-income
                families. The cyclical structure of the criminal justice system in the United States is punishing the
                most vulnerable, and the most poor. As a result, fathers’ absence has become an intergenerational
                problem that is experienced through the bodies of children and mothers.</p>
            <p><em>A Father’s Lullaby</em> invites all men to participate by singing lullabies and by sharing memories
                of childhood, home, and father. My approach is what I call the <em>“</em>Poetic Cyber Movement for
                Social Justice.” It reveals the possibility of mobilizing and bringing together a plethora of voices
                while utilizing public places and virtual spaces to ignite a more inclusive dialogue in both spaces to
                effect social change.</p>
            <p>In this project, art, new media, data information, and personal accounts come together with
                underrepresented stories as the focal point.</p>

            <p>The project is being developed with community members as creative collaborators, and with many local
                artists and partner institutions in different stages of the project, including the MIT Open Documentary
                Lab, Boston Art Commission, Boston Center for the Arts, Federal Probation Office, and The Office of
                Returning Citizens in Boston.</p>
