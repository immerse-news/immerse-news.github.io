            <p>It’s been just about five years since <em><a href="http://likelinkshare.org/">Like, Link, Share: How
                        cultural institutions are embracing digital technology</a></em><em>,</em> was published by the
                Philadelphia-based <a href="https://www.wyncotefoundation.org/">Wyncote Foundation</a>. That study,
                authored by Sarah and Jessica Fiala as independent consultants, was an inquiry into ways that legacy
                cultural institutions were using digital technologies to further their missions, and to see what could
                be learned from the innovators doing the work.</p>
            <p>A major benefit of <em>Like, Link, Share</em> was the number of conversations generated and relationships
                formed, not only between researchers and organizations but among the organizations studied. <a
                    href="https://kovenjsmith.com/">Koven</a>, then at the <a href="https://blantonmuseum.org/">Blanton
                    Museum of Art</a> in Austin, Texas, was one of the study’s interviewees who not only informed the
                study’s themes but, since leaving Blanton, became an <a href="https://www.8bridgesworkshop.com/">8
                    Bridges Workshop</a> collaborator.</p>
            <p>The premise of the report was that digital strategy is no longer optional but essential: the public
                expects to engage with culture digitally, to sample and share, to connect and participate.</p>
            <p>Informed by thorough research into the practices of 40 legacy cultural institutions and site visits to
                eight organizations for deep conversations with staff, the report highlighted five key themes that are
                surprisingly resonant today. Innovators:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>shared an articulated digital strategy tied to their organizational strategy;</li>
                <li>were focused on building capabilities, not projects;</li>
                <li>had re-organized at the senior level to give digital practitioners a seat at the leadership table;
                </li>
                <li>were learning to adapt by orienting toward “audiences first”; and</li>
                <li>were experimenting with all manner of new business models to tie earned and contributed income to
                    new digital capabilities and reach.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Digital adoption remains a challenge for many organizations in the space. Right now, 8 Bridges Workshop
                and Koven are collaborating on a research project looking at the range of digitally-delivered audience
                engagement tools available for services such as mobile ticketing, concierge options, and
                educational/enrichment offerings on behalf of a software developer that serves the cultural sector. From
                close range, they’re continuing to experience the differences in capabilities among cultural
                organizations and the gap between the experiences that commercial entertainment companies can provide
                compared to those available within even well-resourced cultural institutions.</p>
            <p>Koven is also leading a project called the <em><a
                        href="http://mcn.edu/the-museum-technology-charter/">Museum Technology Charter</a></em>, an
                online resource for museums seeking to engage with technology at an organizational level in responsible
                and sustainable ways. The <em>Charter</em> builds on many of the concepts identified in the <em>Like,
                    Link, Share</em> report to provide an operational roadmap for technology implementation in a museum
                of any size or scope.</p>
            <p>The <em>Charter</em> will describe current effective museum practices by looking at technology through
                multiple functional lenses. This is where it will depart from previous reports such as <em>Like Link
                    Share</em> and the <em><a
                        href="https://www.nmc.org/publication/nmc-horizon-report-2016-museum-edition/">Horizon Report —
                        Museum Edition</a></em>. Where these reports looked at technology primarily through a strategic
                lens, the <em>Charter </em>will also examine technology implementation within the context of core museum
                values.</p>
            <p>The structure of the <em>Museum Technology Charter </em>was defined during a convening held in Austin,
                Texas, in the spring of 2019, which brought together 24 thought leaders from across the museum and
                non-profit technology sector, The convening was funded by a grant from the <a
                    href="http://www.kressfoundation.org/">Kress Foundation </a>with the <a
                    href="http://mcn.edu/">Museum Computer Network</a> acting as fiscal sponsor.</p>
            <p>The participants at the convening defined the scope of “museum technology” as consisting of six
                <strong>functional areas</strong> and nine <strong>lenses</strong> through which these functional areas
                can be viewed.</p>
            <p>The <em>Charter’s</em> six functional areas are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>digital engagement</em> (which includes social media and other two-way communication
                    technologies),</li>
                <li><em>online presence</em> (which includes web and other broadcast technologies),</li>
                <li><em>evaluation and analytics</em>,</li>
                <li><em>foundational systems</em> (which includes critical infrastructure and security systems),</li>
                <li><em>business systems</em> (which includes collections management, digital asset management,
                    ticketing, constituent management, and similar systems), and</li>
                <li><em>content development</em> (which encompasses media production and content authoring).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To each of these six functional areas, the <em>Charter </em>will apply the following lenses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>privacy &amp; security</em> (with a particular focus on responsible handling of visitor/user
                    data),</li>
                <li><em>organizational transparency</em>,</li>
                <li><em>data stewardship</em> (which includes conservation and longevity of data as well as licensing
                    models),</li>
                <li><em>sustainability of systems</em>,</li>
                <li><em>inclusion &amp; equity</em> (which includes understanding audiences as well as hiring
                    practices),</li>
                <li><em>accessibility</em>,</li>
                <li><em>decolonization</em> (which involves assessing how data emphasizes dominant ways of knowing and
                    organizing knowledge), and</li>
                <li><em>human-centricity</em> (which involves designing systems to meet user needs, rather than just
                    system needs).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <em>Charter </em>is one indication of museums’ growing capacity for incorporating digital practice
                into their operations and embracing the potential of digital technology across all parts of
                organizational life, from presentation to operations. As these foundational elements of digital practice
                become more regularly embedded across museums and other legacy cultural institutions, the capacity for
                these institutions to foster public engagement with digital artmaking will grow.</p>
            <p>This is good news for artists working in new and emerging forms of technology-infused practice, and
                something to look forward to as leading museums adopt the <em>Charter </em>and work to animate its
                multi-faceted components.</p>
