            <p>For me, storytelling is always less about the tools that I use and more about my desire to create,
                explore and/or express an idea.</p>
            <p>Whether I use a pen, a camera or a computer, my goal is to create new narratives that offer up different
                worlds and futures, and while the methods I use vary, the common factor is passion. This passion is not
                just guided by my artistic endeavors, but informed by my perception that the world I live in is
                dominated by stories that, for instance, value inequality, misogyny and white supremacy. It’s this
                perception that also challenges me to create work that counters these insidious narratives.</p>
            <p>Since I began production on my documentary, <em><a href="http://invisibleuniversedoc.com/">Invisible
                        Universe</a></em>, I have been interviewing people, documenting events and speaking publicly
                about the birth of an informal network of makers of speculative fiction (fantasy, horror, science
                fiction, etc.). The people who make up this movement of Black speculative fiction creators are not
                monolithic. They come from various backgrounds, work in assorted forms and media, have diverse
                perspectives and worldviews, have different access to resources, and work individually, collectively or
                both.</p>
            <p>But they all have at least one thing in common: they all envision worlds and futures much different from
                the limited ones that have been fed to us for centuries. And they have coalesced during a historical
                moment when transformative narratives from a new collective imagination are desperately called for to
                help shift us away from the lack of imagination of the rulers in this world. The people in this
                movement, consciously or not, but definitely <em>passionately</em> have responded to this “call” by
                exploring visionary futures (or presents or pasts) in their various works.</p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F187765957&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F187765957&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F598631132_1280.jpg&amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"

            <p>And yes, this is not the first time that Black creators have used speculative fiction as a way to imagine
                visionary futures. The history of <a
                    href="http://invisibleuniversedoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IU-Infographic-Layout-FINAL_00_TEST3_2500.jpg">Black
                    literature</a> is filled with it. There have even been periods that may qualify as collective
                movements of imagination. First during the second half of the 19th century when creators like Martin R.
                Delany, Sutton E. Griggs, Pauline E. Hopkins and others produced pioneering speculative narratives on
                the Black experience. Then again, more recently in the 1960’s and 1970’s, creators Samuel R. Delany (no
                relation), Virginia Hamilton, Octavia E. Butler and others literally integrated the racially homogeneous
                speculative fiction industry.</p>
            <p>The earliest form of the current movement originally began to take off in 2000, when Sheree Renee Thomas
                debuted her anthology, <em><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MTXJAF2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Dark
                        Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora</a></em>. The book
                single-handedly introduced (or re-introduced) nearly thirty fictional writers and their works to the
                world under the banner of Black speculative fiction.</p>
            <p>The evolution of the movement today has granted it ever-increasing access to computer technologies and
                social media networks, which has allowed it to grow exponentially since that time. But even though this
                movement’s strongest presence is online via social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, its offline
                efforts are not to be outdone. With regional strongholds in places like Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta,
                New Orleans, Seattle and in southern California, these groups are well-represented on a local level. But
                I think the most impressive aspect of this movement is the members’ passionate self-awareness of the
                importance of their collective imagination. Consequently, I believe this passion has inspired them to
                take actions (publishing anthologies, participating at cons and producing their own events, etc.) to
                ensure that their presence has a larger impact on the wider speculative fiction culture — artistically,
                socially, politically and economically. And because of this, the future may never be limited again.</p>
            <p>So, all of this is to say that I believe that storytelling tools are a secondary concern to exploring
                visionary futures. They supplement and may aesthetically enhance stories, but are not necessarily the
                most important element. I believe it is when connections among like-minded people and groups are made,
                like with the Black Speculative Fiction creators or the Detroit Narrative Agency that <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/this-is-the-moment-for-visionary-narratives-7db0d9797ec1#.18mefhhba">adrienne
                    wrote about</a>, that real exploration and envisioning can happen.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite quotes from Octavia E. Butler spoke succinctly to the idea of why she chose to explore
                visionary futures in her own work. “I was trying to write myself in,” she explained. Like Octavia, I
                also value centering people, their connections and their ideas in visionary futures.</p>
