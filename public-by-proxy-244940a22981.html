            <p>We all have the right to protest. This action — to gather peacefully, en masse, on the streets whether in
                public solidarity for a cause or to publicly oppose, call for change or hold accountable — is so
                significant that its protection is written into the legal frameworks and constitutions of democratic
                countries. However, the right to protest is increasingly being curtailed. The UK Government, for
                example, is currently pursuing an <a
                    href="https://www.politics.co.uk/comment/2021/03/16/anti-protest-bill-freedom-dies-in-silence/">anti-protest
                    bill</a> that would put severe restrictions on and criminalize protesting. The vocal opposition to
                the “draconian” bill demonstrates the need to be able to take to the streets but there are, and have
                always been, large groups of society that cannot attend these public events, regardless of the laws,
                even though they might have wanted to. For disabled people, protesting on the street is not always an
                option. Their voices and bodies can be rendered invisible, disenfranchised and depoliticized by the
                spaces and modes in which traditional forms of protest take place. Who gets to be seen and heard in
                public? Who has the privilege of moving through these spaces and who is excluded? Why? And, can this
                change?</p>
            <p>These are some of the questions that <a href="http://arjunhm.co.uk/">Arjun Harrison-Mann</a>, <a
                    href="http://benjaminredgrove.com/">Benjamin Redgrove</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.kaiyawaerea.com/hello">Kaiya Waerea</a> grapple with in their work around proxy
                protesting and the role of design in the disability rights movement in the UK. In 2020, they created
                <em><a href="http://proxyprotest.com/">A DIY Guide to Proxy Protest</a></em><em>,</em> which subverts
                commonplace technologies such as smartphones and video call software to enable alternative ways of
                protesting. It works through a collaboration between a proxy (or stand-in) who goes to the physical
                space of the protest and the protester who streams into the event and is rooted in the culture of DIWO
                (do it with others). The trio’s work straddles the line between practical solutions and provocations —
                as well as being useful objects, these tools also function to start conversations, tell stories and make
                visible those who are usually invisible.
            </p>
            <p>I spoke to Arjun, Ben and Kaiya over Zoom and their care, thoughtfulness and commitment to creating
                access came across in the considered way they interrogated their own ideas, how they expressed
                themselves and how they talked to me and each other.</p>
            <p>[The conversation has been edited for length and clarity and took place before the anti-protest bills
                began being discussed and passed in the UK parliament.]</p>

            <p><strong>Lara Chapman: </strong>Please could you each tell me a little bit about yourselves, your design
                practice and your involvement with disability rights?</p>
            <p><strong>Arjun Harrison-Mann: </strong>We’ve started doing this thing recently where we audio describe
                ourselves, we think it is a way of giving a bit of context of how we identify ourselves and put
                ourselves forward. I’ll start by doing that: I am a tall skinny Indian man, although skinny is not
                happening so much since lockdown [laughs]. I have long hair with shaved sides and a gold nose ring.
                Today I’m wearing a burgundy shirt.</p>
            <p><strong>Ben Redgrove: </strong>My name is Ben Redgrove. I am a white Englishman who is missing the middle
                finger on my right hand. I recently shaved all my hair off, for the want of something better to do
                during lockdown and, as with Arjun, I seem to be going rather round [everyone laughs]. I’m aiming for a
                perfect circle.</p>
            <p><strong>Kaiya Waerea: </strong>My name is Kaiya, I am a young, white cis woman with brown frizzy hair
                which is tied up. I look tired and I’m wearing a scrunched up top and am bit disheveled today but that’s
                okay because no one will see me.</p>
            <p><strong>A.H-M: </strong>I began looking at disability rights mainly through my mum who is disabled and
                has had a history of experiencing the systemic disability benefit cuts within the UK. While I was
                completing my MA, the Tory government were implementing further cuts and, during that time, I started
                using design as a cathartic tool — a way of working through my feelings.</p>
            <p>Ben and I have been working together now for about five years, looking at the role of design within the
                Disability Rights Movement in the UK. Our work is about making protest accessible and looking at the
                relationship between power and presence. Since then we’ve met up with <a
                    href="https://dpac.uk.net/">Disabled People Against Cuts</a> who are an activist group here in the
                UK. Through our friendships, with them and with various other people, we have been getting more and more
                involved. It is about friendships, relationships and being allies. It is also about the work that is
                unseen.</p>
            <p>I think an important thing to note is that our work is grounded in the <a
                    href="https://www.shapearts.org.uk/News/social-model-of-disability">Social Model of Disability</a>
                which is a belief that society disables people rather than that people are disabled. It refutes the
                medical model, which, in short, sees curing and correcting the functioning of an individual’s body as
                the main way of bringing about social integration of people living with various impairments and
                illnesses — which is inherently problematic. The social model instead sees the structures imposed by
                society as disabling, and something to be reimagined.</p>
            <h2 id="2d27">One of the key phrases in the disability rights movement is “nothing about us without us.”
            </h2>
            <p><strong>B.R: </strong>We both come from a design-based background but I think there has always been this
                interesting and quite useful tension between our skills. I come from predominantly moving image,
                narrative-based and installation backgrounds, so I have been really interested in the image-making
                aspect of the things we do and how that takes on value — the power of imagery — as well as the more
                pragmatic design side.</p>
            <p><strong>K.W: </strong>I am a writer and designer and my practice is concerned with chronic illness
                particularly in relation to work, narrative and time. I am interested in forms of knowledge production
                and dissemination and in how temporalities are structured to oppress certain ways of being. I started to
                work through these areas because of my own diagnosis with a chronic illness. I think when Arjun talks
                about cathartic design, I really relate to that because there is this idea of “okay, this thing is
                really happening to me, what tools do I have to understand it?” and my own practice and research is the
                first thing I can reach. That has been a big part of me processing my own experiences.</p>
            <p>I started working with Arjun and Ben about six months ago and that’s been a really exciting place to
                activate some of my concerns in a way that I just couldn’t on my own. The skillset of three expands what
                work is possible and we have quite a spread between us of technical skills.</p>
            <p><strong>L.C: </strong>Before we start talking about <em>A DIY Guide to Proxy Protest, </em>I thought it
                would be interesting to discuss the idea of DIWO (do it with others) that is central to your projects
                and, it seems, your process of working. What is DIWO? How and why do you apply it to your work?</p>
            <p><strong>A.H-M: </strong>DIWO is a really important part of our practice and a really important part of
                caring and thinking about access. It is a term that is used a lot in open-source movements and I think
                it exists to reframe DIY culture — this notion that we all have to do things ourselves, that we are all
                self-reliant and can self-teach.</p>
            <p>Applying the DIWO mentality when thinking about access and activism is really important. One of the key
                phrases in the disability rights movement is “nothing about us without us.” Ben and I are allies to the
                movement so we are always making sure we are making things <em>with</em> people and not <em>for</em>
                them. It’s really important to acknowledge what is at stake when you have a very different lived
                experience.</p>
            <p><strong>L.C: </strong>Yes, I think the design industry is often guilty of not taking time or care to
                consider and forces solutions down people’s throats which aren’t really practical or created with
                empathy.</p>
            <p><strong>A.H-M: </strong>Yes, or solving the wrong thing…</p>
            <p><strong>B.R: </strong>I think that the idea of collaboration in our work is both a necessity and a
                political stance. I think the two come hand-in-hand. It is vital in this context as it is how you get
                things done and how you can work together to negotiate a potentially insurmountable situation.</p>
            <h2 id="7252">You cannot come up with all the answers and there’s nothing wrong with that; there is
                something quite wonderful about needing other people.</h2>
            <p><strong>K.W: </strong>Yes, and it is important in unsettling this idea of independence. Listening to you
                both talk made me think about the main disability benefit in the UK — the <a
                    href="https://www.gov.uk/pip">Personal Independence Payment</a>. The point of that benefit is to
                make you independent which, of course, can be great and empowering but independence isn’t necessarily
                the marker of a good, fruitful and safe life. Being positively and mutually dependent on other people is
                actually a really important and amazing thing. I think that DIWO speaks to that notion that you can’t
                know and do and solve everything. You cannot come up with all the answers and there’s nothing wrong with
                that; there is something quite wonderful about needing other people.</p>

            <p><strong>L.C: </strong>That’s a really lovely way of thinking about how we live and what we prioritise.
                DIWO is central to your recently published website/work/protest tool <em>A DIY Guide to Proxy
                    Protest</em> which relies on the collaboration between two people. How did this guide and protest
                tool come about?</p>
            <p><strong>A.H-M: </strong>When we talk about proxy protest more generally, it is essentially a way of
                pairing one person who might not be able to leave their homes, for a number of reasons, and a person who
                is able to be at a protest in physical space and connecting them through live streaming and the
                subverting of ubiquitous technologies such as phones. It is about repositioning phones on the body to
                create a way in which you can move and act on behalf of somebody else.</p>
            <p>More specifically, <em>A DIY Guide to Proxy Protest </em>is the most recent of our attempts at looking at
                ways that we can make protest accessible and reimagine what access looks like. We’ve been thinking a lot
                about the role of the proxy — the stand-in — in creating new ways of thinking about access and new ways
                of caring. What does it mean to act in tandem with another person and to have a different type of
                accountability?</p>

            <p><strong>B.R: </strong>The original version and intention of it was to subvert that idea of a single,
                top-down surveillance camera — a body camera — and then this becomes a much more collaborative form of
                accountability. Not just that, but it becomes a way of negotiating space as a duo which I think is quite
                powerful as an action to do with someone else.</p>

            <p><strong>L.C: </strong>Does it also intend to start a conversation with other people at the physical
                protest about living with a disability? I ask because there are certain design decisions you’ve made
                that seem to facilitate this, for example, the camera could just face outward so that the person
                streaming into the protest isn’t visible but you have chosen to show the person on the screen.</p>
            <h2 id="a650">…often, wider systems and governments diminish a person’s visibility as a way of marginalising
                them…</h2>
            <p><strong>A.H-M: </strong>When we think about making spaces exclusive and accessible, visibility is a
                really important part of that because often, wider systems and governments diminish a person’s
                visibility as a way of marginalising them. So, one of the things that the proxy tool tries to do, and
                the reason it is important to have the person visible at a protest, is about reclaiming a sense of
                power. There is an assumption that being present in a space has a power with it, so how do you reimagine
                that? Another part is about encouraging that dialogue, it can be quite hard to have this kind of
                dialogue and forms of engagement with people purely from screens so what happens when you make that a
                performative action? What happens when you embody that?</p>
            <p><strong>K.W: </strong>I proxied for a member of <a href="https://dpac.uk.net/">Disabled People Against
                    Cuts</a> [DPAC], at an event that Ben and Arjun did with the Serpentine Galleries called <em><a
                        href="https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/power-tour-disabled-people-against-cuts/">The
                        Power Tour</a></em><em> </em>in 2019<em>. </em>I was there physically with my phone attached to
                my harness through which the person I was paired with was streaming virtually.</p>
            <p>It was very moving for me to take on that direct responsibility of another, being a sort of surrogate for
                them in those physical places for others to interact with. Because they were visibly present on the
                screen, it wasn’t just between me and him, other people were approaching me and talking to him through
                my body.</p>
            <p><strong>B.R: </strong>I proxied at a protest outside Facebook’s headquarters in central London. I think
                one of the strongest things, as Kaiya really nicely articulated, was that feeling of being a conduit, of
                facilitating interactions between a mass of comrades, a mass of friends.</p>
            <p>For me, there was a level of intensity from the members of security, who themselves had body cameras. I
                remember there was this strange feeling of them being quite confrontational, assuming that I was
                recording and then me trying to explain that that wasn’t the case. I also felt quite empowered because I
                was acting on behalf of another, or we were acting as a two, so I felt able to stand in that position in
                a much stronger way. That’s not to say that I was doing anything out of the ordinary but there was
                definitely a different feeling of empowerment and feeling watched over.</p>
            <p><strong>A.H-M: </strong>When you are in these experiences, it is quite vulnerable for all involved. I
                think that is a really powerful thing.</p>
            <p><strong>B.R: </strong>The other side of that is the aspect of negotiating the mechanics of being a proxy
                — what you’re standing in front of, making sure that you move in a certain way and taking care in how
                you move.</p>
            <p>Although, we don’t want to fetishise the technology or think that it will provide us the solution of a
                platform that means we don’t have to worry anymore. I think the important thing is how you have to shape
                yourselves <em>into</em> specific circumstances in order to better converse, better negotiate or come to
                a greater understanding together, rather than assuming that will be done by some kind of machine.</p>
            <p><strong>A.H-M: </strong>It is about this balance of what we need in terms of technology to make spaces
                accessible and what we leave to how we perform. Recently we’ve been thinking more about how you can also
                <em>act</em> in a way that is accessible and inclusive.

            <h2 id="294f">…it is not so much a product, it is more of a provocation. We’re trying to make very
                ubiquitous materials defamilarised as a way of provoking thought.</h2>
            <p><strong>B.R: </strong>I think that is a really important part of it because ultimately, and we’ve tried
                to do that with the DIY guide, it is not so much a product, it is more of a provocation. We’re trying to
                make very ubiquitous materials defamilarised as a way of provoking thought.</p>
            <p><strong>L.C: </strong>There is an interesting tension between private and public spaces that operates in
                all your work, but especially this idea of navigating protests from the space of a home via a digital
                medium. Could you speak about what “public” means to you and the proxy tool?</p>
            <p><strong>K.W: </strong>I think that the idea of public and private in relation to political action and
                politics is super dangerous because it sets up a dynamic where that which is public is political and
                that which happens in private is apolitical. Johanna Hedva speaks about this really well in their essay
                <a href="http://www.maskmagazine.com/not-again/struggle/sick-woman-theory">Sick Woman Theory</a>. If
                actions have to be public to be deemed political then whole hosts of people are depoliticised with
                disabilities by not being able to get their bodies onto the streets. That is what the <em>Proxy
                    Tools</em> start to address: how can these bodies also be on the streets?
            </p>
            <p>I think that there is also something to be interrogated further within these categories. In a time of
                wide image sharing and video calling and the different ways that we can enter each others’ spaces, I
                think that public and private becomes what you share online and what you don’t share online. I don’t
                think those barriers are as physically spatial as they once were. They are more visual-based.</p>
            <p><strong>L.C: </strong>That’s really fascinating. Towards the end of what you were saying I got the sense
                that you think we might be moving in the right direction where those boundaries are breaking down, or do
                you think we are still quite stuck in that idea of private and public as separate?</p>
            <h2 id="9829">That is what the Proxy Tools start to address: how can these bodies also be on the streets?
            </h2>
            <p><strong>K.W: </strong>I wouldn’t say that we are moving in the right direction… I think that there is a
                really urgent tension that is caused by cultural representation becoming separated from political
                representation. We need to look at what it means when it <em>feels</em> like things are getting better
                because people are more represented in cultural spaces but actually that isn’t reflected in turn through
                political representation. This can feel confusing, contradictory and misleading. Political
                representation often <em>seems</em> like it happens publicly but it actually happens privately, in
                meeting rooms and closed-door spaces. I think that re-examining the locations of “the public” is a
                really important thing in relation to disability because so much of one’s experience as a disabled
                person has to happen in private spaces because of how public spaces are designed.</p>
            <p><strong>B.R: </strong>There’s definitely something in what you were saying, Kaiya, in that the
                relationship between public and private takes on a very specific form in terms of disability. I hadn’t
                ever thought about the bringing of private spaces into public or the convergence of those two things,
                which is essentially what the original <em>Proxy Tool</em> does.</p>
            <p><strong>A.H-M: </strong>When Kaiya talks about Johanna Hevda and their main provocation of “how do you
                throw a brick through the window of a bank if you cannot leave your bed?”, that really talks well to
                this idea of public and private.</p>
            <h2 id="db3c">…who are we talking about when we talk about “the public”? Is it those that are visible? I
                think that is probably the case a lot of the time.</h2>
            <p>First of all, who are we talking about when we talk about “the public”? Is it those that are visible? I
                think that is probably the case a lot of the time. Also, it’s interesting to ask: do we ever feel like
                we are members of the public? Who are we addressing and why? Why are we making certain things public?
                Who already has the privilege of being part of that public space? These are all provocations that don’t
                have particularly easy answers but they are things we need to work through. I think to make something
                public means to make something visible again. There are many ways that we can use that word but for me,
                it always comes back to visibility.</p>
            <p>To make something public is to evidence it, so we need to be aware of the politics of doing that. What do
                we need to evidence and what do we not? What do we need to make visible and what do we not?</p>
