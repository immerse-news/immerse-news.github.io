            <h3 id="bdf9">Surveying recent social media archives of street projections that subvert official narratives
                in South America</h3>
            <p>In November 2020, Peru — which already had been <a

                    economic crisis</a> — experienced <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/world/americas/Peru-president-Francisco-Sagasti.html">a
                    moment of extreme political instability</a>, leading to the impeachment of then president Martín
                Vizcarra. This sparked a massive wave of civil unrest, as it was seen as a coup orchestrated by the
                opposition forces in the parliament.</p>
            <p>As the crisis unfolded, the use of a particular tactic stood out: street projections. Ingenious
                protesters reached the house of Manuel Merino — Vizcarra’s replacement in the presidential palace — to
                tell him that he was not their president, making clear that they wanted him out of office. This tactic
                <a href="https://twitter.com/carcaramantin/status/1327433873442136065">also targeted TV stations</a>,
                which were deemed to be accomplices of the illegitimate regime for their negative portrayal of the
                people marching in the streets.

            <p>Tragically, during the night of November 14th, two young protestors — Inti Sotelo and Jack Bryan Pintado
                — <a
                    href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2020-11-15/al-menos-dos-fallecidos-y-decenas-de-heridos-por-violencia-la-policial-en-peru.html">were
                    killed by the police</a>. The morning after, Merino stepped down from government after five
                catastrophic days in office. Activists continued to project statements, but now they had a different
                tenor. Projections were no longer a tool of protest. Projections now were a tool of memory: to
                memorialize the deaths of those who valiantly confronted an illegitimate regime.</p>

            <p>Luminous interventions have been gaining ground globally in recent years for multiple purposes. However,
                artists and activists in Latin America seem particularly keen to employ projections as a remembrance of
                historic political episodes. This has been the case in <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CHwV627BlrX/">Chile</a>, where the 2019 and 2020 protests employed
                projections to remember the cases of human rights abuses committed by their military and police.
                Similarly, in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-GV5pVgxK9/">Argentina</a> projections bring back
                the faces of the <em>desaparecidos</em> of the military dictatorship. In <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDubwj4nmwp/">Brazil</a>, activists remember fallen fellows,
                recent victims of violent right-wing extremists.</p>
            <p>The affordances of projections certainly offer two prominent advantages: portability and spreadability.
                First, in contrast with other expressions such as graffiti and posters, the message of the projections
                is not fixed to the support (e.g. walls). So, as long as one can move the necessary devices around the
                city, the same message can appear in different spaces and/or at different times. The file containing the
                message can also be distributed to different individuals with adequate equipment and, with enough
                coordination, the message can be projected in different places simultaneously. But whereas graffiti and
                posters remain in their places until they are taken down, projections are only visible while the device
                is on. Paradoxically, the messages compelling us to remember fade when the light goes off.</p>

            <p>Social media users have worked their way around this issue. The custom of capturing and posting
                remarkable moments or events have created — sometimes inadvertently, others purposely — an <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/gritaluz/">archive of these luminous manifestations</a>, storing
                their message in a more stable form: bytes in a database. Here the message acquires a second layer of
                spreadability. As publications are shared, the message reaches new persons: these memories are now not
                only available to those who witnessed a projection in a public space as it was happening but also to
                those who come across a post on social media.</p>

            <p>Certainly, these platforms have their own high dose of ephemerality. As any social media user knows,
                there is a propensity to quickly jump from one topic to another. Without any indexation or curatorial
                labor, these images of messages fade away when the projector is turned off. Fortunately, there are users
                dedicated to preserving these images in dedicated social media accounts. By storing, curating, and
                indexing these shareable images, these users create what we could name as spreadable archives.</p>
            <p>Examples of these practices of archiving can be found in different platforms, although Instagram seems to
                be the preferred choice. For instance, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coletivoprojetacao/">Coletivo
                    Projetação</a> from Brazil is a long-standing collective that <a
                    href="https://www.sympla.com.br/oficina-projecao-ativista-modo-de-fazer-com-coletivo-projetacao__1079543">started
                    in 2013</a> and does projections on a wide range of topics — from <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CA8twxmJH6b/">anti-racism</a> to <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CA_q5jrpEb_/">abortion legalization</a>. A much more recent
                initiative is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lanuevabandadelaterraza/">La Nueva Banda de la
                    Terraza</a> from Colombia, which <a
                    href="https://cerosetenta.uniandes.edu.co/en-medellin-la-protesta-2-0-se-hace-desde-el-balcon/">started
                    in 2020</a>. Under their motto #aisladosperonocallados (#isolatedbutnotsilent), they started making
                projections as an alternative way of protesting during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            <p>These archives are not free of complications such as ownership. These platforms are owned by corporations
                and there are no publicly owned alternatives. As a consequence, the registers of all these messages
                invoking the public memory are ironically privately owned. They do not belong to the public and our
                access to them can change according to corporate decision-making processes. The luminous messages that
                moved across an open public space, once turned into digital images, now circulate through private
                digital infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Besides these general technological issues, Peru has its own complex relationship with historical memory.
                After the period of internal conflict during the eighties and nineties, the transition government of
                Valentin Paniagua in 2001 organized a Truth Commission in charge of clarifying the crimes and human
                rights abuses committed during these decades. The commission produced <a
                    href="https://www.cverdad.org.pe/ifinal/index.php">a detailed report composed of nine volumes</a>.
                Given the evident impracticality of such work for dissemination purposes, an <a
                    href="https://lum.cultura.pe/cdi/documento/hatun-willakuy-versi%C3%B3n-abreviada-del-informe-final-de-la-comisi%C3%B3n-de-la-verdad-y-0">abridged
                    version</a> of the report was produced. Still, this version was more than 500 pages long. An <a
                    href="http://repositorio.pucp.edu.pe/index/handle/123456789/111953">even briefer publication</a>
                containing only the conclusions of the report was also produced. Other alternatives, such as <a
                    href="https://lum.cultura.pe/cdi/documento/barbarie-comics-sobre-violencia-pol%C3%ADtica-en-el-per%C3%BA-1985-1990">comics
                    focusing on particular events</a>, were also published.</p>

            <p>Written accounts of our collective memory are still necessary because they stabilize narratives. Over the
                centuries, the book as a media form has been fundamental for the dissemination of information. People
                also share and discuss what they read. But, unlike the projections highlighted in this piece, with books
                information consumption happens primarily between one person and one object. Furthermore, the fact that
                Inti and Jack died as a result of recent state-sanctioned violence complicates the production of
                official media memorializing them. In contrast, public projections have been mostly led by artists,
                activists, and common citizens.</p>
            <p>Projections in public spaces do not replace expressions in other media forms. What they offer are new
                possibilities for how memories can be told and retold. They move memories out of books or museum
                exhibitions and into the streets. In this sense, it could be said that projections in these spaces make
                memory truly public. Moreover, their ephemerality also reminds us of the continuous labor that memory
                requires. Names, events, and ideas that are not mobilized are destined to wither. It is up to each one
                of us to bring them back. Let us not forget.</p>
