            <p>MONTE ALBAN, Mexico—Summer vacation 2018: I am staring at an obelisk, pondering my place in the universe.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>Physically, I am incontrovertibly <em>here</em>, surrounded by pre-Columbian ruins, many engineered to
                interpret the movement of the cosmos from this precise spot on the planet.</p>
            <p>Mentally, though, I am wandering through a haze of associations: other archeological sites I’ve visited
                while remaining keenly self-conscious of my own role as a tourist, the resonance of ruins as a trope for
                understanding our own evanescence, the way the bowl of the sky and the configuration of the stars once
                served to both situate and awe our predecessors.</p>
            <p>It’s this twin feeling—of being both embraced and dazzled by the heavens—that VR film <em>Biidaaban:</em>
                <em>First Light</em>—taps into. Premiering at <a
                    href="https://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/biidaaban-first-light-2018">Tribeca Immersive</a>, where
                I experienced it, the piece brings viewers into a future Toronto where nature is reclaiming the ruined
                city.
            </p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F263191226%3Fapp_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F263191226&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F692659650_1280.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"
                    width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
            <p>Beautifully executed, the room-scale VR rains down stars, which coalesce into words written in three
                First Peoples languages: Mohawk, Wendat, and Ojibway. These phrases prompt consideration of our
                relationship with nature, and our assumptions about linear history.</p>
            <p>Charmed inside this imaginary scene, I wander to peer over the edge of a rooftop—and, jarringly, find
                myself inside a green-gridded matrix. Like Daffy Duck <a
                    href="http://www.criticalcommons.org/Members/sammondn/clips/duck-amuck/view">battling with his
                    animator</a>, or Truman sailing to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn5kuDdeGzs">edge of
                    his world</a>, I’d come face-to-face with the boundary of this reality.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/300/421/1*BsehGlWqD0WL43YOzYjqJg.jpeg"
                    width="300"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>My confusion is further compounded when I remove the headset and exit into an antechamber which separates
                me from the main exhibit space. There I encounter a lone turtle in a lighted tank, staring at itself in
                a mirror. I photograph it, looking at itself, or perhaps looking at me looking at it.</p>
            <p>I can tell from the text written on the wall that I am supposed to be contemplating my relationship with
                both language and nature—it reads, in part, “The original book is, of course, the world itself.” But at
                this moment I just feel a bit sad for the turtle, trapped in meta-commentary.</p>
            <p>If <em>Biidaaban: First Light</em><em><strong> </strong></em>brings the stars down to earth, another
                piece at this year’s Tribeca Immersive exhibition, <em><a
                        href="https://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/spheres-pale-blue-dot-2018">Spheres: Pale Blue
                        Dot</a></em>, brings users up into the galaxy to witness the Earth’s origins.</p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F264514261%3Fapp_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F264514261&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F694315059_1280.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"
                    width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
            <p>This, too, is a tethered VR experience, which gives me freedom to roam a few steps as the Big Bang
                unspools around me, narrated by Patti Smith. The feeling of space here is vast, arid and lonely,
                emphasizing the beginnings of sound as well as matter. The installation where users stand is itself
                sterile—a smooth round room, painted white but coolly lit in a glowing blue. It strikes me a bit like
                the planetariums of old—grand and swooping but not emotionally gripping.</p>
            <p>Space and sound are also married in <em>Where Thoughts Go: Prologue.</em> While the graphics in this VR
                experience are less sophisticated than many of the other pieces in this exhibition, its power lies in
                the intimacy of hearing others’ dreams and confessions, and the prospect of sharing your own.</p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FfaRQTRDJDBE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DfaRQTRDJDBE&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FfaRQTRDJDBE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"
                    width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
            <p>Here, space is neither a friendly companion to our terrestrial journey, nor a mysterious void from which
                we came—but a symbolic backdrop, signaling our suspension in another world where users interact with
                animated orbs representing previous participants’ answers to intimate questions. The set of this
                installation, too, was different: a kind of harem tent, where you sit on cushions and snuggle into the
                interaction.</p>
            <p>In the end, the projects that I found most intriguing at Tribeca this year weren’t the ones that evoked
                the celestial but instead created concrete spaces to explore here on Earth.</p>
            <p>At first, <em>Objects in the Mirror AR Closer Than The Appear</em> just looks like the jumble of boxes
                that some of us might be trying to avoid in our own basements. Begin to poke through the piles with an
                augmented reality (AR) headset, however, and surprises begin to pop out.</p>
            <p>“The piece is about our relationship to objects,” co-creator Graham Sack tells me. “The theatrical show
                that it was adapted from, <em>The Object Lesson</em>, is about people’s relationships to physical
                objects…and what we’ve done with this media exhibition is extend that to the digital realm. What we
                wanted to do with AR was give people an experience where they pick something up out of context in the
                environment and it suddenly becomes a jumping off point for a memory or a previous relationship.”</p>
            <p>Part of what makes this interaction delightful is the array of whimsical AR headsets that users can
                choose from: a wooden box, a welder’s mask, an actual lampshade you wear on your head. “Because the
                exhibition is about our relationship to things, we wanted to make sure the viewers were themselves
                beautiful objects,” says Sack. “In working with our budget we discovered these 19th century stereoscopes
                that have exactly the same optics as modern viewer goggles. Using them was a way to juxtapose the
                bleeding edge of technology with its history.” Through these, participants can see, hear or explore
                digital experiences prompted by directing their gaze towards boxes or objects.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>“Every asset is carefully curated, but there is a bit of a treasure hunt involved in terms of the user
                finding exactly what will trigger it,” says Sack. “The space is organized as an archeological dig, with
                a digital layer and a physical layer. We wanted to convey the sense that everything has the capacity to
                take us to another place.”</p>
            <p>I stop in front of a painting with my headset and suddenly find myself inside of it. Sack explains that
                this 360 video has been altered to “create the appearance of a 19th century world. When you use it with
                the AR headset the painting comes to life and you break through the frame and are fully immersed in the
                scene.”</p>
            <p>While this technology is not perfect, the ability to wander freely in the space and explore, and the
                familar junkshop feeling of snooping around other people’s semi-public memories does the trick. I feel
                for a moment engaged and transported, wrapped in someone else’s creation.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The same sort of logic applies to a more melancholy installation, <em>Queerskins: A Love Story.
                </em>Created by Illlya Szilak, the experience was inspired by her work in the 1990s as an AIDS doctor.
            </p>
            <p>Participants are led through a re-creation of the attic bedroom of the story’s subject, Sebastian, a
                young gay physician who is estranged from his rural Catholic family and dies of AIDS. There, they
                experience a virtual ride to the cemetery in the backseat of a car with his conflicted parents, next to
                a virtual box of his belongings that they can comb through. Those same actual objects populate the
                installation space, where visitors are encouraged to pick them up, move them around, and be photographed
                with the one that moves them most for sharing on the project’s <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/queerskins/">Instagram site</a>.</p>
            <p>“As a physician, I understand how embodied material, historical reality, is really important,” says
                Szilkak. “And there’s this human reach for transcendence — through art, through technology, through sex
                — but at the end of the day you’re going to take your VR set off and you’re still going to be gay or
                you’re still going to be black.”</p>
            <p><em>Queerskins </em>is striking in its range of both entry points and souvenirs. A poster-sized handout
                offers a map of the space, along with stats and resources about AIDS treatment. An <a
                    href="http://www.queerskins.com">online interactive narrative</a> includes the diary, audio
                monologues, videos, and photos. Hand-crafted “take-aways multiples” provide participants with a poignant
                one-of-a-kind object to bring home—I choose a vintage postcard overwritten with text from Sebastian’s
                diary. Giving participants permission to move the props gives them a sense of authorship. As I leave, I
                reposition the contraband vintage <em>Tom of Finland</em> porn front-and-center, so that it is no longer
                hidden from the next visitor.</p>
            <p>All of this is subjective, of course. Having a resonant physical space to explore is not necessarily the
                secret to more profound immersion. The physical does not always trump the digital.</p>
            <p>Back at Monte Alban, I never do quite click in to the requisite sense of mystery and history. The ancient
                city is mostly empty, populated only by other early tourists and vendors selling reproductions of
                ancient gods and archetypes. The narrative of the site feels closed, already written. The sense of local
                particularity is diluted by the global visual language of explanatory plaques.</p>
            <p>So, I dutifully do my part to steal one more sliver of the site’s aura, by transmuting the space into
                digital memories.</p>
