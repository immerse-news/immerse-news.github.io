            <p>This winter issue centers disability innovation in documentary and emerging tech — presenting
                perspectives from artists, activists, scholars and technologists at the vanguard of storytelling and
                disability justice. It’s inspired by existing efforts from our collaborators at the Access and
                Disability Innovation Working Group at <a href="http://opendoclab.mit.edu/">MIT Open Doc Lab</a> and <a
                    href="https://cocreationstudio.mit.edu/">Co-Creation Studio</a>.</p>
            <p>Lightning talks from artists, technologists, curators and scholars hosted by the working group provided a
                jumping off point for reflection for the Immerse editorial collective. The publication typically engages
                emergent technology forms that historically have not accommodated disabled artists and audiences. One of
                our issue pieces in particular, a<a
                    href="https://immerse.news/into-the-museum-of-austerity-b973dcfbed5e">n interview with Sacha Wares,
                    the director of the IDFA award-winning Museum of Austerity (2021)</a>, is directly inspired by one
                of the talks in the working group’s symposium.</p>
            <p>With this issue, we aim to share learnings that inspired us, lessons learned in the creation and
                exhibition of art that centers access, that recognizes disabled people in the wholeness of their
                experiences, across the many spectrums and intersections of identity. We also wish to share the harsh
                realities, the impacts of access initiatives that fall short, enacting change that is unsustainable and
                harmful.</p>
            <p>I ask our readers, creatives across the spectrum of engaging with (or perhaps persisting through)
                conversations around disability and access in their day to day, to consider these pieces with an open
                mind. Allow yourself forgiveness, time to “be.” In keeping with the spirit of many of these pieces, sit
                with the feelings of resonance, acknowledgement and discomfort, and commit yourself to learning and
                unlearning in the ways you can.</p>
            <p>Some of these are stories of creative workarounds and “finessing,” of breaking apart and manipulating
                systems in place to imagine new realities. These stories speak of frustration, of triumph and of not
                only wishing for a new status quo, but detailing the steps needed to get there. Others call out ableist
                bullsh*t like they see it, like Leora Fridman’s <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/make-medicine-sick-b5006bcf8ba0">critique of Apple’s </a><em>The
                    Greatest</em><a href="https://immerse.news/make-medicine-sick-b5006bcf8ba0"> (2022) the newest
                    disability ad that she argues falls short in nuance and representation</a>. And don’t miss Aubrie
                Lee’s <a href="https://immerse.news/how-innovation-sets-me-backwards-91b30e0b6b95">gripping essay
                    explaining how technology that could be enabling her as a wheelchair user and self-proclaimed
                    “cyborg” instead sets her back</a>.</p>
            <p>Our writers introduce us to a range of cutting-edge accessible tech — some of which, like <a
                    href="https://medium.com/p/143b4acb15f8/edit">Dylan Fox’s speculative fiction piece on being blind
                    in 2040</a>, hasn’t yet been invented. From Laurel Lawson, dancer, choreographer and engineer, <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/how-can-art-reach-out-and-touch-us-8917a3ffb710">we get an introduction
                    to Protactile and the potential of haptic tech to revolutionize disabled dance and performing arts
                    spaces</a>. In their Zoom campfire chat, Chris Hainsworth and Harshadha Balasumbrian of Blind
                Burners <a href="https://immerse.news/vr-beyond-sight-6a086f24147c">reflect on their collective’s
                    challenges in making a virtual reality (VR) experience accessible for blind and visually impaired
                    creators and audiences — under the time crunch of Burning Man 2021.</a></p>
            <p>Beyond the baseline of access (which we continue to emphasize as a necessary precondition of showcasing
                work), this issue also features ways of exhibiting and cultivating creative experiences that are
                intimate, intentional and trauma-informed. In her interview with seeley quest, <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/embodiment-as-an-entry-point-at-the-intersections-of-art-tech-care-168fc5f1f67e">multisensory
                    artist Salima Punjani presents a plethora of ways of structuring care into art practice, spanning
                    everything from heartbeat biodata to bubble baths</a>. <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/words-in-noise-looking-for-a-deaf-voice-amidst-the-noise-aa20627adbb7">Artist-scholar
                    Dr. Frank Mondelli grapples with questions about what it means to center Deaf, hard of hearing and
                    disabled perspectives in their subversive re-imagining of the hearing exam</a> — surfacing questions
                about how to design not only for a Deaf and/or disabled audience, but for a hearing, able-bodied one as
                well.</p>
            <p>Now, I am proud to present perspectives from folks who do the day-to-day work of capacity building,
                existing both in solidarity and in allyship in order to create a more just, accessible world. As a
                first-time editor (from start to finish), I feel grateful for many things: the organizing efforts,
                triumphs and trials of activists such as Stacey Park Milbern, Alice Wong, Mia Mingus and Leah Lakshmi
                Piepzna-Samarasinha that have uplifted disability justice to the visibility we see today. The grace,
                sheer talent and patience of all the contributors. The fact that we are able to put this issue into the
                world. The labor of love that Immerse is for our editorial collective — many claps to associate editor
                Omar El-Sabrout, joining for this issue.</p>
