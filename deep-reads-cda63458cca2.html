            <h3 id="c5af">Immerse issue #13: On engaging with AI</h3>
            <p>At the new Co-Creation Studio at the MIT Open Documentary Lab, we’ve identified artificial intelligence
                as one of our key research areas because it is so disruptive and because we sit in a center of AI
                development and research. As documentarians, journalists, and artists, we feel a responsibility to
                engage with the most central issues of the day, to understand, educate, and speak truth to power.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool, but it’s the people who understand and can influence its
                trajectory that hold the real power. Let’s make that all of us—now is the moment to jump in and steer it
                to good. I offer this reading list as a place to start.</p>
            <p>The idea that a machine can think like a human challenges the very essence of what it means to be human.
                What is intelligence? Consciousness? Emotion? Creativity? What are the processes behind them? Can our
                brains really be mapped onto a machine? <a
                    href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-happened-in-ai-in-2017">Developments </a>in artificial
                intelligence in 2017 alone certainly raise the question.</p>
            <p>As far back as the 1950s, John McCarthy—credited with coining the term “artificial intelligence”—and
                Marvin Minsky, a former professor at MIT, thought so. They founded the artificial intelligence lab at
                MIT in 1959.</p>

                    width="333"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>Minsky wrote two foundational books in the field, <em><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Society-Mind-Marvin-Minsky/dp/0671657135/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514583835&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=society+of+mind+minsky">Society
                        of Mind</a></em><em> </em>(1986) and <em><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Emotion-Machine-Commonsense-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0743276647/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514583793&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=the+emotional+machine">The
                        Emotion Machine</a></em> (2006) — both of which posit that there is no real difference between
                humans and machines. Minsky and McCarthy believed that machines could be trained to think like humans.
                In <em>Society of Mind</em>, Minsky presents a theory that he developed together with Seymour Papert
                that the mind is made up of many interactions by unintelligent “agents” that when joined together become
                intelligent. For Minsky, “there is not the slightest reason to doubt that brains are anything other than
                machines with enormous numbers of parts that work in perfect accord with physical laws.’’ In <em>The
                    Emotion Machine</em>, Minsky argues that emotions are just another way to think and are
                indistinguishable from any other thinking process.</p>
            <p>The quest to create intelligent machines is a deep-seated human pursuit and today, with the rise of big
                data, more powerful computers, and better algorithms, machines are taking over cognitive processes never
                before possible. But whether machines will truly achieve human intelligence, and even go beyond, is a
                source of great debate, as is what to do about machines that are behaving more like us or that will
                eventually surpass us. The ethical issues are profound.</p>

            <p>An excellent introduction to the field is MIT professor Max Tegmark’s <em><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-3-0-Being-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1101946598/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514583695&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=life+3.0">Life
                        3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</a></em><em>. </em>Published in 2017 and
                aimed at a general audience, it maps the AI landscape and explores fundamental issues. What should and
                should not be automated? Should an autonomous machine be held accountable for its actions? Will machines
                possess suprahuman intelligence and if so, how will we handle them? How can we ensure that AI is
                beneficial to society and not a detriment? Tegmark explores important questions and this is the most
                recent, comprehensive book available about artificial intelligence for a lay audience.</p>

            <p>Another book exploring what it means to be human in the age of intelligent machines is <em><a

                        Most Human Human</a></em> by Brian Christian. Christian decides to compete with the world’s
                leading AI programs at the annual Turing test competition. As the author’s website describes, he “ uses
                their astonishing achievements as well as their equally fascinating failings to reveal our most human
                abilities: to learn, to communicate, to intuit, and to understand. And in an age when computers may be
                steering us away from these activities, he shows us how to become the most human humans that we can be.”

            <p>Authors declaring that the human mind can be understood and mapped onto machines include the futurist Ray
                Kurzweil, who studied under Marvin Minksy, in his book, <em><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/0143124048/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514584278&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+to+create+a+mind">How

            <p>But intellectuals such as Noam Chomsky are skeptical. In an <a
                    href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/noam-chomsky-on-where-artificial-intelligence-went-wrong/261637/">article</a>
                in <em>The Atlantic</em>, Chomsky notes, “It’s worth remembering that with regard to cognitive science,
                we’re kind of pre-Galilean, just beginning to open up the subject.” Granted, it was written in 2012, but
                he is still critical.</p>

            <p>Cathy O’Neil is not only skeptical that machines can think like humans but warns of the dangers of
                intelligent systems in her book, <em><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418831/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514584351&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=weapons+of+math+destruction">Weapons
                        of Math Destruction</a></em><em>.</em> She describes how mathematical laws and logic can’t
                contain the massive complexity of nature and human lives. Every intelligent system is reductive and
                therefore a threat to society.</p>
            <p>Researchers and scholars, including some of those inventing intelligent systems, are concerned about the
                potential for AI to deepen inequality if left unregulated, accessible to few, and without thoughtful
                planning. Unfortunately, American politicians are absent from this debate, which is yet another problem.
                Europeans and Canadians are engaging more.</p>

                </em>by Samuel Arbesman, who offers “a field guide to living with complex technologies that defy human
                comprehension.”</p>
            <p>As technology grows more complex, <a href="http://www.arbesman.net/overcomplicated/">Arbesman argues</a>,
                “its behavior mimics the vagaries of the natural world more than it conforms to a mathematical model. If
                we are to survive and thrive in this new age, we must abandon our need for governing principles and
                rules and accept the chaos. By embracing and observing the freak accidents and flukes that disrupt our
                lives, we can gain valuable clues about how our algorithms really work. What’s more, we will become
                better thinkers, scientists, and innovators as a result.”</p>

            <p>The AI debate is heated. Opinions are strong. Activity is frenetic. We’re in the midst of a revolution
                akin to the development of the steam engine, says MIT professor <a
                    href="http://ebusiness.mit.edu/erik/">Erik Byrnjolfsson</a>. The AI gold rush is in full swing as
                tech companies, businesses, and governments try to cash in. Scientists are rapidly making breakthroughs
                while researchers, scholars, and activists are sounding the alarm about the dark side of an AI
                revolution left unchecked. Everyone is trying to steer AI’s trajectory towards their version of an ideal
                society.</p>
            <p>Although AI is much covered in the media, citizens are just beginning to understand what it is. It’s not
                easy to keep up given the pace of innovation, the complexity of human intelligence, and its profound and
                broad social implications. But the need for AI literacy is paramount. Without transparency and good
                governance, too much can go wrong: from perpetuating and increasing bias, to deepening the divide
                between the rich and poor, to mass surveillance, filter bubbles, and missing the opportunities to call
                out bias and make <em>all</em> of our lives better—not just an elite few.</p>
