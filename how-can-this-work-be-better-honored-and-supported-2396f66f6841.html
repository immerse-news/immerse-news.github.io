            <p><strong>Maria:</strong> First, these three things: funding our work, exhibiting our work, and writing
                about our work, such as in film and media criticism and history, reviewing it in the journals and trades
                and news media. It is also important that editors hire and assign writers and reviewers with enough
                cultural, social, and aesthetic background to capture more of their nuance and context!</p>
            <p><strong>Michèle:</strong> I also think it’s about having the people of color in positions of power
                shaping co-creation conversations and processes. And I’m not sure I am entirely comfortable with this
                honoring idea. I believe it’s even deeper than that. I already know what we’re worth and I know what
                we’ve done. <em>Honoring</em> speaks directly to those who have ignored or been unaware of the work that
                has always been there. <em>Honoring </em>doesn’t address deep structural inequity. It’s about shifting
                the current power dynamics, which requires a daily practice of self-awareness by those with power and
                leverage. There’s a deeper dynamic that has to do with the pathology that’s outside of us and outside of
                our communities. I’m not sure how to do that because the problem is not here. Right? So, we’re having
                this conversation but this is not where the problem is.</p>
            <p><strong>Thomas:</strong> But I would say but we are also a part of the solution. We’re at a critical
                moment historically both in terms of our independent work and in terms of what’s happening within the
                industry. We have critical context to add to this conversation. I tell my students it’s really important
                to protest injustice but it’s also important for us to be aware of our power to build as honestly as we
                can from where we are, which is why the documentation of this conversation is so significant.</p>
            <p>It’s actually similar to another a conversation amongst a group of queer African-diasporic filmmakers
                that Raul Ferrera Balanquet and I organized in the early to mid-’90s tackling issues around funding and
                distribution as well as marginalization and invisibility we experienced in the midst of the New Queer
                Cinema movement. We used our power to write ourselves into history but instead of this Google document,
                we used the fax machine to construct the dialogue.</p>
            <p>This document, <em>Narrating Our History: A Dialogue Among Queer Media Arts of the African Diaspora</em>,
                was published in Germany in the mid-’90s and was recently re-published in Yvonne Welbon and Alexandra
                Juhasz’s book <em><a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/sisters-in-the-life">Sisters in the Life: A
                        History of Out Lesbian Media Makers</a></em>,<em> </em>as it is the oldest documented discussion
                among Lesbian media makers. I agree that it’s important to identify the problem (whether injustice or
                inequality) and it’s just as important to really interrogate our own power, and our relationships with
                like-minded or like-spirited communities, and to be responsible for historicizing ourselves as [we] make
                media.</p>
            <p><strong>Michèle:</strong> I agree with that and I’m working in universities and exploring the same kinds
                of ideas. However, there is a work practice of self-awareness that has to happen on the other side.
                That’s what has to happen. We’re having this important conversation and there also needs to be a
                parallel conversation in white communities about racialized power and where does co-creation practice
                fit into that.</p>
            <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Also, it’s not a question of our asking for permission as filmmakers of color,
                although of course we need funding. What’s happening is that audiences are diversifying in the U.S.,
                that the balance of power in global audiences is changing. As of last year China overtook North America
                as the box office superpower, and American media-making will become obsolete if our cultural media
                stories remain provincial and focused on one white privileged storytelling mode.</p>
            <p>Audiences want to see a reflection of themselves and are becoming more diverse and international. And in
                the one media system that is mission-supported, as opposed to profit-supported, in our American media
                world, I would love to have a more diverse public TV. I would love to have more programmers in that
                system who are diverse and reflect the complexion of America and who choose to air more diverse media
                with nuanced and complex representation. I would love more executives in the system who understand that
                greenlighting and funding diverse programs is imperative to serving the American public given our
                demographics. Unless we see representation in all aspects of media-making there will be a continued
                decline in audiences for this media; the field won’t be successful.</p>
            <p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Yeah. Work has to move beyond simply having a black face as Executive Producer,
                or another figurative role which looks good on paper, which is sometimes what is passing as co-creation
                in mainstream circles right now. There needs to be more investment in communities as well as the next
                generation of filmmakers connected that have a deeper level of connection to these communities.</p>
