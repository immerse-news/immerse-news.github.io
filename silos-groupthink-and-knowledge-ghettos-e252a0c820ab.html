            <p>Early in 2015, I had a conversation with a lovely man who leads the futurist department for one of the
                largest tech companies in the world. His team would imagine the future with the company’s pipeline
                technologies and build out offices and homes in the vision of these technologies. He showed me a short
                film about how they were imagining the future, and it felt exciting in terms of the technology
                capabilities, but a bit soulless. I asked if he had anyone from the arts and humanities on his team. He
                said “No, just engineers.” I asked, “How are you imagining the future without people from the arts and
                humanities?” He genuinely looked flummoxed and said, “Wow, that’s a blind spot.”</p>

            <p>We have plenty of precedents that suggest that blind spots can be dangerous. When I was in grad school,
                we were given a case study that identified the primary reason for the Columbia Space Shuttle tragedy:
                groupthink. NASA’s homogenous and top-down management structure caused them to have major blind spots,
                even willful ones that led to the explosion. How do you counter <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.concerttech.com%2Favoid-technology-rollout-groupthink%2F">groupthink</a>?
                Besides remaining open to criticism and training team members in group decision making, the two critical
                counters are to work with diverse groups of people and to include members outside the group in meetings
                and decision-making. Throughout the <em>Making a New Reality</em> interviews I heard artists,
                scientists, policy experts, entrepreneurs, and technologists lament the silos that isolate respective
                fields of knowledge in the design and imagination of our future.</p>
            <p>Of course, this relates back to the previous articles on the need to diversify emerging media from an
                identity and regional perspective. Countering groupthink involves includes a diversity of identity
                backgrounds, as well as a diversity of fields of knowledge and discipline. See <a

            <h3 id="dae0">Designing with blind spots</h3>
            <p>Robert Wong, the lead of Google’s Creative Lab, raised concerns about the marginalization of people from
                the arts and humanities in the tech sector. Others have raised concerns about the marginalization of
                technologists in the arts and humanities sectors, especially those in the gaming sector who are not
                considered “serious” contributors to society, even though they possess a high set of skills and a full
                working knowledge of social structure, tech and code, business, and the arts. The concern goes back to
                the notion that, if we do not have diverse kinds of people and skill sets contributing to the design of
                our future, we may fail to create systems that are human-centered and inclusive.</p>
            <p>Multiple people said that they are also concerned that fundamentals of history and philosophy are missing
                from the knowledge base of tech leadership. Interviewees shared various anecdotes of conversations with
                leaders at major tech firms who did not have a fundamental understanding of the historical dynamics that
                shape current cultures. They fear that these blind spots could lead to unintended cultural and political
                disruptions, especially when considering powerful tools such as AI.</p>

            <p>“I think [tech firms] need more artists and more critical engineering, meaning engineers who have history
                degrees, which is a thing that has basically vanished,” says Luke DuBois, artist, creative technologists
                and researcher at NYU’s Brooklyn Experimental Media Center. “So that’s a problem: It’s not even art
                that’s missing, it’s the broad stroke of liberal arts…That’s how they make those mistakes, where they
                roll out an image labeling system that labels African-American people as <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fmzhang%2F2015%2F07%2F01%2Fgoogle-photos-tags-two-african-americans-as-gorillas-through-facial-recognition-software%2F%2348debc10713d">gorillas</a>…Those
                are easily preventable f**k-ups that could be mitigated if people had a better breadth of education and
                understanding of the social impact of their research.”</p>
            <p>Miles Perkins (VP of Communications at Jaunt) identified our education system as one major source for
                these silos of the arts and humanities, engineering, and business in the tech and media fields, saying.,
                “We have taught a generation of students to value STEM over STEAM [which adds “Arts” to Science,
                Technology, Engineering and Math] in the last 25 years.” As a former employee of Lucasfilm’s Industrial
                Light &amp; Magic and now an executive at a Silicon Valley VR startup, Perkins has seen major challenges
                in translating ideas across these silos. Britt Wray (artist, journalist, and biologist) similarly
                described this gap between the arts and sciences, adding that it is not only a lack of shared language
                that becomes a stumbling block, but a lack of respect for each others’ fields of expertise.</p>
            <p>Luke DuBois agrees, “Part of it is the universities’ fault. For the last 15 years we’ve been STEMifying
                the sh** out of everything we do, so if you do computer science at Stanford, you get pipelined straight
                into Facebook or Google, but for that degree program, you don’t really have to take any humanities
                classes in depth. Because math — like pure math, and pure physics — count as liberal arts, because
                they’re not applied classes, they’re theory classes. So then you take, like, freshman English so you can
                write a five-paragraph essay, but you don’t have to really engage with or know anything about society.”
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately, DuBois sees some attempts to change course, “We’re trying to fix this over at NYU now. We’re
                developing a core curriculum for engineering students to counteract that, so they all have to take an
                ethics class, and they all have to take a history and philosophy of science and technology class, so
                that they understand that this stuff doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Because you only know what you know, so
                it’s not their fault. It’s our fault for letting them get away with it.”</p>
            <p>Nancy Schwartzman, an artist, technologist, and activist also called for breaking these silos through the
                education system. “If every new student at MIT and Caltech had to take a civics class about
                intersections of gender, ability, race and class oppression, and [if the class could] challenge students
                to harness the power of technology to address these problems and subvert these structures, we’d probably
                get more civic-minded technologists and art.”</p>
            <p>Golan Levin, Associate Professor of Electronic Time-Based Art at Carnegie Mellon School of Art, was very
                generous with his analysis of the issue, “When our students go and try and learn programming over in
                computer science, first (as Leah Buechley has pointed out) those departments teach programming with
                certain kinds of assumptions. Those assumptions are that you are probably going to go to work in a
                cubicle at a big company like Microsoft. Therefore, they don’t teach you to work in ways that are
                improvisational. They teach you to work in ways that are planned. But artists like to work
                improvisationally. In computer science, you’re just not going to learn to work improvisationally.
                Instead, it’s more about computing a plan or satisfying a task that’s been given to you by a manager..
                Second, computer science education traditionally assumes that you learn from abstract principles:
                ‘Here’s the equation. Here’s an abstract description of how it works. Now you know the material. Now you
                take the test.’ Artists don’t learn that way. They learn from making concrete examples, not from
                abstract principles. So, for artists, learning is often much more tinkering-driven, curiosity-driven,
                creativity-driven, and actually, hands-on with code — where you make stuff to figure out what’s
                makeable.”</p>
            <p>To tackle this issue, all students studying game design at Carnegie Mellon are required to study improv.
                According to Drew Davidson, professor at Carnegie Mellon, improv teaches students to get over ego and
                focus on the scene and story, as well as how to work on a team that prioritizes the improv principle of
                “Yes, and…” rather than starting from “no.” This simple change in attitude, key to improvisational
                theatre, drastically impacts the tech field. VR maker Paisley Smith agrees with Levin, that Davidson’s
                approach is effective at expanding the critical thinking computer scientists and designers. She said she
                often reflects on a conversation she had with Davidson and has drawn of it as she developed her own work
                style at the intersection of art, tech and film.</p>
            <p>Levin states, “The third issue, and this is more of a cultural thing, you go into a computer science
                department and there’s a strong bias towards making things which are utilitarian rather than
                expressive,” He explains: “Your job is to make this vending machine or this banking software, but an
                artist says, ‘Well, this doesn’t really speak to me.’ [Take] someone like Lauren McCarthy, who is doing
                incredibly important work in, not only creating tools but in providing documentation that gives artists
                a leg up in learning stuff and which has diversity built in as a value. Lauren’s an ideal example. You
                have someone who’s trying to make a programming environment for new learners, for people who are young
                and from different backgrounds, who are not necessarily going into this because they want to get a job
                with Google, but because they realize that code is a 21st century artistic medium that they want to use.
                There’s a really important opportunity to support the open-source arts engineering tool kits, and
                foundations could be doing that, but it’s a challenging thing to explain to [foundations], I think.”</p>
            <h3 id="b2b3">Hyper-capitalism and short-termism</h3>
            <p>Marisa Jahn and other interviewees describe a time in the last century where STEAM was held in high value
                at places such as MIT and Bell Labs, which were creating intersectionality between these fields. They
                admit that there are programs for artists in tech companies, but many of them are “tinsel” and not
                rigorous. There was a sense of lament among these interviewees that the value systems of exponential
                economic growth and hyper-capitalism, as described by Douglas Rushkoff in his book <em>Throwing Rocks at
                    the Google Bus</em>, have encroached on the time, space, and resources for this kind of
                cross-pollination of ideas. Often driven by short-term gains, the free market has failed to account for
                long-term profits, impacts on culture and quality of life that breaking these silos can generate.</p>
            <p>As<em> </em>Dayna Evans <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecut.com%2F2016%2F09%2Fvirtual-reality-women-run-the-world-c-v-r.html">reports</a>
                at NYMag.com, <em>“</em>When Mark Zuckerberg announced the purchase of Oculus VR for $2 billion in 2014,
                the first thing he said he intended to do with it is make better games. The second was enhancing the
                experience of ‘enjoying a courtside seat at a game.’ ”<em> </em>Although Zuckerberg’s vision of the
                utility of virtual reality for gaming and sports is valuable as a way of better serving the audiences
                for gaming and sports, some argue that it illustrates a narrow vision of the medium that a
                cross-pollination of ideas from people of different backgrounds could help to broaden.</p>
            <p>“The technology is there to service the art, not the other way around,”suggests Maureen Fan the CEO
                Baobab Studios and an animation artist. She explained that the myth still persists that investing in
                higher artistic values and more rigorous stories for mass media products (for example, casual games)
                will limit, if not dissolve, profit margins. The <em>Harvard Business Review</em> published a case study
                on the development and success factors of Pixar and found that making heightened story the primary brand
                value and technological excellence a secondary core value was the key to the studio’s exponential
                economic success. Some argue the VR industry suffered from a tech-first mentality in 2016, when the
                industry pushed hardware to launch ahead of an abundance of meaningful or cohesive content.</p>
            <p>Eugene Chung, former head of Oculus film department and current CEO of Penrose Studios, shared that is
                was very difficult to get the company to invest in storytelling experiences in the beginning. Of course,
                there are valid arguments that sometimes artists are too attached to their creations and fail to make
                the hard business and engineering decisions that would enable them to reach beyond the niche, indie
                audiences. In recent years, Oculus has more deeply invested in non-gaming and non-sports experiences,
                stories, and communication functions. Due to the efforts of a host of advocates, the industry quickly
                course-corrected and invested more heavily in content in 2017, and now high quality content is being
                acquired out of festivals like Sundance Institute’s New Frontier at <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Fvr-film-spheres-huge-sundance-deal%2F">seven
                    figures</a>. Could this blind spot been avoided if artists had a greater locus of power in the
                beginning?</p>
            <h3 id="db34">It’s hard to break silos</h3>
            <p>Some interviewees talked about the challenges of having people with deep knowledge of code and technology
                in conversation with people who just understand the end-user experience, but have creative ideas about
                how to make better designs. This can be difficult for both sides of the dialogue.</p>
            <p>Tracy Fullerton, Director of the Game Innovation Lab at USC, explains that much of the siloed culture
                comes from day-to-day interactions: “There’s this kind of nerd macho, coding really long hours. There’s
                this way that we think of ourselves, and it is not friendly. It’s not inclusive it tends to not invite
                others into its sphere. So, even if you go in as a freshman to study computer science, you are on a
                daily basis going to be faced with this sense that you’re not invited.”</p>
            <p>Yelena Rachitsky, Executive Producer of Experiences at Oculus, discussed her experience at the crossroads
                of storytelling and technology, “I come from the art world, and now I’m in a place that is a mixture of
                tech, at a company that’s majorly engineering focused [Facebook] and at Oculus, which has its foundation
                in the gaming space. I think part of the gap between the arts and tech is just that people come in from
                what they know and they tend to stay in that community. It’s just how you learn to think. It’s how you
                learn to value things, and so now that there’s this convergence, we’re having to re-open our minds to
                realize, ‘Oh, maybe this works better a different way.’ And that is not an easy thing to do. It’s also
                not an easy thing for me to do. I find myself having a hard time getting into the gaming mindset or the
                engineering mindset, coming from the film world. I’m used to it being very hierarchical, with the
                director first. In the tech world, it’s much more hierarchical with engineering first. And before I was
                in a world where the tech people just did what the creative people asked them to do. And now I’m having
                to realize that’s also a biased way to think, because the tech is just as important as the creative,
                because they’re the ones who are actually making it all possible.”</p>
            <p>Wray, journalist and former scientist, explains a similar dynamic in hard sciences: “It feels like
                artist/scientist collaborations are still a marginal practice. Artists get invited into scientific
                spaces rarely, compared to those with the hard tech and hard engineering skills, because they’re
                perceived as less valuable. The artist or storyteller comes in and gets to benefit by learning about the
                atmosphere, the environment, the materials, and tools that all these scientists are using. They get to
                make captivating content that attaches their imagination to what the scientists are doing, but generally
                the scientists are sitting there thinking, ‘What do I get from this? I’m sharing my lab bench with you,
                but how do I necessarily incorporate what you have to show me into my work?’ This is an ongoing question
                in synthetic biology. We need to get clearer about what the benefits are to scientists and how it could
                be more collaborative, rather than like a one-way partnership.”</p>

            <p>Wray explained that one of her biggest concerns is that small scientific communities such as synthetic
                biologists are making huge decisions that could affect the fundamental design of human bodies in the
                next twenty years without being in discourse with other fields of knowledge, such as the arts and
                humanities. “It’s too much responsibility.”</p>

            <p>One executive from a major tech company developing AR capability described his excitement for the medium
                becoming a computing platform at a SXSW dinner in 2016. “Won’t it be great when you can do your emails,
                wearing an AR device, like this [held up his hands and air typed, as if on a standard keyboard].” He was
                quickly followed by an artist at the table, with a dance background, who said to a shocked audience, “If
                I no longer have to be bound by a keyboard, why in the world would I want to air type on a hologram
                version of one? I’d rather do this [she performed a series of lyrical gestures].” This is an example of
                how different viewpoints might spark a wider scope of approaches to new technology, which is lost in a
                siloed environment.</p>
            <p>Dan Novy, MIT Media Lab engineer, is a strong advocate of bridging this gap, especially in media
                innovation. Not only should artists and technologists collaborate more intimately to optimize the
                technology, he thinks they should do so earlier in the process. He notes the current process typically
                does not involve media makers until the product comes to market, then the artist is creatively
                constrained by the limitations of the technology. They either play inside the lines of the tech or hack
                the tech to get results the original product does not provide (i.e., James George &amp; Jonathan
                Minard’s hack of Kinect technology to create computer vision cameras in <em>CLOUDS</em>). The engineers
                see the hack and iterate the product to better match the artist’s needs. Novy says this cycle would be
                more efficient if the artists were collaborating with the engineers from the beginning of concept.</p>
            <p>McCarthy explains that, “One problem is that it’s really hard to get any support for building tools,
                because it is not the central thing. It’s an alternative model, or it’s just not as flashy to be
                building the tools that are underlying the final installation. But, I think that’s where you need the
                most diversity, because a tool is not neutral. It reflects the ideas of its creators. If we have one
                homogenous group making all the tools that we make our art with, our stories will all be shaped by
                what’s possible in the tool. So, I guess that’s why I focus my attention there.” McCarthy is an artist
                and programmer, and the creator of the tool <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fp5js.org%2F">p5.js</a>, a javascript library
                which makes coding accessible to creators.</p>

            <p>Scott Snibbe, an interactive artist and creative technologist, describes the first time he used the Apple
                II computer, back in the beginning of personal computing. As an artist, he saw the blinking green cursor
                on the jet-black screen as pure possibility, an infinite and multi-dimensional creative canvas. So, when
                Microsoft issued its operating system and put the entire universe of possibilities that existed on the
                black screen into a desktop framework, he was devastated. The immense creativity of this medium was now
                under the mental constraints of work/office productivity. He had to circumvent this framework in his
                practice for decades, before Apple gave him a new infinite and multi-dimensional canvas in the iPad
                tablet. With that new tool, he has created some of the most astounding UX/UI designed works in the
                field, such as Bjork’s Biophilia concept album.</p>

            <p>These gaps between scientists, technologist, engineers, the artists and humanities experts are similar to
                identity divisions among people in emerging media, in that once you get past the friction, you realize
                the people on either side are more alike than not. In this instance, both the arts and the sciences are
                charged with investigating what it means to be human and how we might improve our state of being. They
                both explore truth and require imagination. They help us understand our minds and bodies. They hold up a
                mirror to humanity. They open our imaginations to what could be.</p>
            <h3 id="2c07">Groupthink in emerging media</h3>
            <p>Interviewees identified several areas of emerging tech and media that seem to suffer from groupthink, due
                to a lack of rigorous diversity and a failure of rich cross-field discourse. This month’s supplemental
                articles aim to share some of those concerns:</p>
