            <p>Most of the concerns about equality in emerging media that <a

                But their “boundary issue” concerns are more focused on mitigating our vulnerability to <a

            <p>Some say, “If you have nothing to hide, there is nothing to worry about, right?” If we look to the future
                dystopia narratives such as <em>Minority Report </em>or <em>Black Mirror</em>, we begin to see cracks in
                this argument. Interviewees for the <em>Making a New Reality</em> research identified the lack of
                boundaries that comes with the advent of new technology as especially <a

            <p>For example, many of the African-American interviewees referenced the constant <a
                    href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">sophistication
                    of systems of oppression</a> that affect their lives and communities as a source of their anxiety
                about this next phase of media disruption. “What might be used against us that we don’t even see
                coming?”</p>
            <h3 id="690a">A history of surveillance and discrimination</h3>
            <p>I can personally relate to these fears. As a child of the Civil Rights generation and a member of the Hip
                Hop generation, I experienced a traumatizing shift in tactics of oppression of my community from the
                1980s to now.</p>
            <p>My parents and grandparents were very active in the work of racial unity and equality, starting in the
                1950s. For example, my white grandmother help to start the NAACP in Maine and was a community organizer
                until the day she died. My black father did a Freedom Ride to the South in the 1960s that almost took
                his life. He was chased by the Ku Klux Klan out to the swamps, where he had to hide in a shack for three
                days without food. However, by the time I came along many of the civil rights movement’s goals had been
                presumably achieved. This created a belief that although there were still obstacles to overcome, the
                path was relatively clear for our generation to reap the benefits of the equality and equity our parents
                fought to win — the <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, Civil Rights Act, and the Voting Rights Act
                (Still working on the <a href="http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/">Equal Rights Amendment</a>.)</p>

                    disconnect between the Civil Rights and Hip Hop Generation at the dawn of mass incarceration.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>Despite the negative stereotypes that commercial media would have us believe, the Hip Hop Generation’s
                music and culture called for the continuation of our parents’ work by being proud of our heritage and <a
                    href="https://genius.com/Public-enemy-fight-the-power-lyrics">fighting the powers</a> of oppression.
                The movement crossed over from music to every aspect of art, media, lifestyle and culture. Public Enemy,
                Arrested Development, Spike Lee films, KRS-One, Mary J Blige, X-Clan, Sister Souljah, The Roots, Erykah
                Badu, Tribe Called Quest, De La Sol, The Fugees, Rennie Harris, Mos Def, Saul Williams, Queen Latifah,
                Dead Prez, Digable Planets and Common were just a few of the cultural leaders that steeped us in
                messages of our nobility and called us to advance the community. Unfortunately, we didn’t understand the
                power we needed to “fight” had morphed significantly from the explicit Jim Crow segregation laws, police
                dogs, and burning crosses that our parents faced. We were <a href="https://vimeo.com/89163487">like
                    frogs boiling in a pot of water</a> that didn’t understand the dynamics of <a
                    href="http://newjimcrow.com/">The New Jim Crow</a> that were killing and imprisoning us at
                unprecedented rates.</p>
            <p>Even more disturbing was how the curation of negative images and narratives about Hip Hop had been so
                effective in drowning out the positive aspects of the culture, biasing consumers of mass media globally
                to think of it as criminal. This dehumanization and disempowerment even caused rifts to appear between
                the Civil Rights and Hip Hop generations, which deeply impacted our resilience in the face of this new
                type of oppression. The negative media representation made it acceptable, even heroic, to imprison a
                generation of black and brown people, deeply disrupting kinship systems, economic mobility, and the
                political power needed to fulfill “the dream.”</p>

            <p>“Is this just paranoia?” I’ve wondered that myself at times. Indulge me, as I explain one way I wrestled
                with this question in my own life.</p>
            <p>I lived through the Blood and Crip wars of the 1980s and early ’90s, the LA Riots, and the ramp-up of <a

                    illustrates systemic traps in black and brown communities.</span></figure>
            <p>When I “got out,” I <strong>swore</strong> I would <strong>never</strong> put my children through the
                trauma of growing up in a war-zone like that. However, in 2013, LA’s affordable housing crisis caused me
                to consider moving back. I was desperately looking for an affordable place in a good school district and
                failing. A friend said, “You may need to face the fact that you can’t afford to live anywhere but the
                ghetto. It could be good for your kids. They need to get a little more street smart and be around more
                black folks.” All of a sudden the trauma of my childhood boiled in my blood and a feeling of rage raised
                up in me. How dare he tell me to put my children in harm’s way! Then a wave of guilt washed over me, “Am
                I a sell out? Am I over-reacting? Am I just being paranoid?”</p>
            <p>In the end, I decided to take on a second job, move to a smaller (more expensive) apartment in a good
                school district in a racially, economically and religiously mixed community. Although having two jobs
                and three kids as a single mother took a major toll on my health, my kids were safe from the dynamics of
                “the ghetto” — poor education, fear of violence, unjust policing — and the mental health issues that
                comes from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5840448/">socioeconomic oppression</a>. Still, I always
                had this nagging voice in my head: “Are you a sell-out? Will your kids know who they are, not being in a
                predominantly black community?”</p>

                        Center</a></span></figure>
            <p>Then I attended Matthew Mitchell’s workshop at <a href="http://eyeofestival.com/">EYEO Festival</a> in
                2016 about the <a
                    href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/59kq75/crypto-harlem-video-surveillance-of-black-community">over-policing
                    and over-surveillance in black and brown communities</a> and those questions were answered. Mitchell
                exposed a rigorous and often times illegal network of emerging technologies used to surveil black and
                brown people in concert with deeply unjust practices (such as stop-and-frisk, <a
                    href="https://www.crimeandpunishmentdoc.com/">summons quotas</a>, and gang injunction laws) that
                fuel mass incarceration, disruption of kinship systems, and socioeconomic oppression.</p>
            <p>My heart sunk to see it all laid out so clearly. I thought about all of the people I’ve known to get
                trapped by this system, but I also felt a rush of validation: “I’m not a sell-out or paranoid — I dodged
                a bullet.” My children would have been placed in the middle of a maze of invisible traps if I moved to
                the “ghetto.” And, unlike me, who had two parents to help me navigate the neighborhood, my children
                would be more vulnerable to these invisible traps with only one working parent. And, unlike me, they
                would be faced with systematized racism that is <strong>exponentially</strong> more <a

            <p>To be clear, I am very aware of the privilege I have in even being able to make the choices I made for my
                children. I am also aware of the deficits my children will have in not being in a community with more
                opportunities for affinity, because of the traps fueling issues like the<a
                    href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/juvenile-justice/school-prison-pipeline"> schools to prison
                    pipeline</a>. Finally, I’m deeply humbled by the parents (single and partnered) doing the amazing
                job of raising children with dignity, purpose and nobility in the midst of neighborhoods targeted by
                structural oppression and helping them navigate through the maze (like my own parents did for me and my
                four siblings). However, I believe firmly that these resilient and phenomenal parents should never have
                to worry about<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kalief-browder-1993-2015"> their
                    child</a> getting abducted by the police for alleged petty crimes and placed into an adult
                penitentiary for years before they are tried in a court of law, with much of the time in solitary
                confinement. That is unacceptable. We can not allow new technologies and media practices to worsen this
                dynamic.</p>

                lack of boundaries. Not only do interviewees discuss their concerns about <a
