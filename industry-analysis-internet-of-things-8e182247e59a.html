            <p><em>Media innovation does not happen in a silo. It happens in concert with emerging technology, advances
                    in science, changes in the cultural sector, and thought leadership from many other fields of
                    knowledge. Therefore, it is important to understand the suite of new technologies and innovations
                    that are changing the human communication architecture and our social systems.</em></p>
            <p><em>What are the media-related emerging technologies? How will they be used in society, industry and
                    commerce? What is their economic value? Each month we look at a different category of technologies
                    and share some of what we’re finding out about them. This month we’ll take a look at the Internet of
                    Things.</em></p>
            <p>One of the bleeding-edge areas of innovation in emerging media is happening in the area of connected
                objects and environments, also known as the “Internet of Things” (IoT). These range from smart homes, to
                connected cars, to bluetooth-enabled medical devices, to environmental sensors and well beyond. How will
                media makers communicate stories, share and gather information and generate experiences using
                IoT-enabled immersive and dynamic canvases?</p>

                    role in our daily lives</a>, from manufacturing automation to nanorobots used in healthcare. In one
                interesting example, Peter Thiel is an investor in a 15,000-square-foot lab in Emeryville, California,
                that remotely gives scientists access to robots. Clients may ask the robots to perform an experiment and
                share the results via the internet. One of the goals of this lab is to amass a huge amount of data from
                these experiments, in the hopes of finding correlations between experiments.</p>
            <p>One insight that companies have identified about the public’s relationship to smart technology adoption
                is articulated by Ana Jorvick in the <em><a
                        href="https://makinganewreality.org/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2016%2F10%2Fthe-mainstreaming-of-augmented-reality-a-brief-history">Harvard
                        Business Review</a></em>: “[D]espite the increased use of such technologies, consumers are not
                yearning for the robotic digitization of their everyday lives. Rather, they want technologies that weave
                themselves seamlessly into their activities. Consumers expect their digital experience to be more human
                and empathic, to be filled with emotional content, to surprise them with serendipitous occurrences, to
                allow for reciprocity and interactivity, and to offer the option of personalized adaptations.” This need
                for more sympatico devices opens up creative opportunities for artists and interface designers.</p>
            <p>For example, some years ago, artist and MIT researcher Ben Rubin created a fleet of small robots that he
                unleashed at a public event. The robots, called <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblabdroid.com%2F">BlabDroids,</a> had large
                eyes and small bodies, and asked attendees emotionally probing questions in an innocent, childlike
                voice. Their intentionally manipulative design yielded unbelievable results — incredibly vulnerable
                videos of people truthfully answering the questions, while being recorded by each robot. Rubin’s
                experiment offered an important lesson about how humans could interact with smart objects. This is one
                example of how the infinitely dynamic and dimensional sandbox for creative media might emerge.</p>

            <p>The IoT market has both business-to-business and business-to-consumer implications. Industrial IoT (IIoT)
                will be a significant part of the market. This segment of the market includes self-optimizing
                production, automated inventory management, remote patient monitoring, smart meters, track and trace,
                connected cards, distributed generation and storage, fleet management and demand response, all of which
                can be achieved by using “sensors, computers, robots and other machinery that interact with each other
                and their environment over a network, transmitting real-time data that, with the aid of an analytics
                platform, can be used to improve manufacturing processes.” Statista predicts that <a

            <p>Media makers and authors have been preparing for the advent of connected things for decades, with
