            <p>Interactive, immersive, participatory forms of documentaries are comprised of complicated ecosystems.
                They mix and match available digital (and sometimes analog) tools as if there is no tomorrow. How do we
                save these intricate systems from becoming obsolete? That is the million dollar <a

                Institute for Sound and Vision, coming up on May 5. Experts from archives, museums, libraries, game
                companies, as well as artists, scholars and activists will discuss “future proofing emerging digital
                documentary forms.” This team will grapple with the million dollar question.</p>

            <p>The issue of digital preservation has long been on the agenda of librarians and archivists. We can track
                the earliest mention of “<a href="https://archive.ifla.org/IV/ifla63/63kuny1.pdf">Digital Dark Ages</a>”
                by Terry Kuny to the 1997 conference of International Federation of Library Associations and
                Institutions. His paper even puts the fear of 1984 in us by opening with a slogan from Orwell’s Party:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In <em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/re-collection">Recollection: Art, New Media, and Social
                        Memory</a></em>, authors Richard Rinehart and Jon Ippolito bring the question to the realm of
                new media art and explore examples by creators from Nam June Paik to Danger Mouse. In addition to the
                rapidly evolving technology, they discuss the complicity of institutions and law in the obsolescence of
                digital art.</p>
            <p>Speaking of institutions: Christiane Paul — Adjunct Curator of New Media Arts at the Whitney — discusses
                the preservation challenges of digital art in her comprehensive talk:</p>

            <p>Perhaps no other institution cares more about born-digital artworks than Rhizome, a web-native itself.

            <p>Let’s talk ethics. In “<a

                    Our Failure of Care Around the Legacies of Marginalized People in the Archives</a>,” archivist
                Bergis Jules points to the unbearable whiteness of his profession, and the worrying lack of diversity in
                the field that is in charge of preserving our cultural heritage. One of Jules’s recent endeavors is <a
                    href="http://www.docnow.io/">Documenting the Now</a> (DocNow) which is “a tool and a community
                developed around supporting the ethical collection, use, and preservation of social media content.” A
                <em>must follow</em> project if you want to do things right!
