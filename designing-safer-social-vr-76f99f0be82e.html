            <h3 id="27d0">Using the ideology of sexual consent to make social VR a better place</h3>
            <p>By Michelle Cortese and <a href="https://medium.com/@andreazeller">Andrea Zeller</a></p>
            <p><em>Imagine it’s your first time entering a social virtual reality experience. You quickly set up an
                    avatar, choosing feminine characteristics because you identify as female. You choose an outfit that
                    seems appropriate, and when you’re done, you spawn into a space. You have no idea where you are or
                    who is around you. As you’re getting your sea legs in this new environment, all the other avatars
                    look at you and notice that you’re different. Strange avatars quickly approach you, asking
                    inappropriate questions about your real-life body; touching and kissing you without your consent.
                    You try blocking them, but you don’t know how. You remove your headset fearing that you don’t belong
                    in this community.</em></p>
            <h3 id="3fac"><strong>New worlds, old problems</strong></h3>
            <p>The above role play is based on various accounts of avatar harassment in social VR applications, reported
                by women in recent years. In 2016, Taylor Lorenz, a staff tech writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>, garnered
                attention from various social VR start-ups by sharing her experience in a virtual reality chat room. In
                that essay, she describes being greeted with unsolicited “virtual kisses” and asked about her real-life
                body by multiple users, noting that she felt ripped from the virtual world and transported back to
                middle school.</p>

            <p>Soon after, <em>VRChat </em>publicly vowed to make safety a top priority after VR game designer, Katie
                Chironis shared a graphic recording of sexual harassment in one of their chat rooms. After that, a 2018
                study conducted by Jessica Outlaw for VR communication service Pluto, reported that nearly half of the
                female-identifying VR participants have had at least one instance of virtual sexual harassment. And
                while these cases are unique in the broader harassment landscape, they are a notable facet of an
                emerging market.</p>

            <p>As female designers working in VR, my co-worker Andrea Zeller and I decided to join forces on our own
                time and write a comprehensive paper. We wrote about the potential threat of virtual harassment,
                instructing readers on how to use body sovereignty and consent ideology to design safer virtual spaces
                from the ground up. The text will soon become a chapter in the upcoming book: <em><a

            <p>After years of flagging potentially-triggering social VR interactions to male co-workers in critiques, it
                seemed prime time to solidify this design practice into documented research. This article is the product
                of our journey.</p>

            <h3 id="6d63"><strong>The illusory virtual self</strong></h3>
            <p>So why did we feel like we <em>needed</em> to take action on social VR harassment? Because when you’re in
                VR, interactions can feel real. During an early social VR demo, we discovered a bug that caused avatar
                hands to stick together when two users were in a virtual room. Two participants who didn’t know each
                other in real-life found themselves holding hands in VR, and when they took off their headsets blushing,
                as if they really held hands.</p>
            <p>This sensation of experiencing a virtual body as your own is called “virtual embodiment.” Take the
                “virtual hand illusion,” for example — a VR variant of the “rubber hand illusion,” conducted by VR
                researcher Mel Slater. When a visible rubber hand (or, in this case, a virtually visible rubber hand) is
                put in front of a test subject, they tend to process potential sensations and threats inflicted on the
                fake hand as real experiences. This is an example of how the brain can<strong> </strong>form a
                connection to a foreign body.</p>

            <p>When this happens in virtual space, and someone threatens or violates your virtual body, it can feel very
                real. This is particularly worrisome as harassment on the internet is a long-running issue; from
                trolling in chat rooms in the ’90s to cyber-bullying on various social media platforms today. When
                there’s no accountability on new platforms, abuse has often followed — and the innate physicality of VR
                gives harassers troubling new ways to attack. The visceral quality of VR abuse can be especially
                triggering for survivors of violent physical assault.</p>
            <p>According to Abraham Maslow’s <em>Hierarchy of Needs</em>, feeling safe is a basic human right — in any
                place. And since social VR places have many of the hallmarks of real-world social places, we should be
                to crafting safety into our virtual experiences. It’s important that we do it now, while social VR is
                still young and the standards are being set. Safety and inclusion need to be virtual status quo. This
                notion is likely so obvious to us because, as women, we think a lot more about safety in real life.</p>

            <p>Don’t believe us? See this Jackson Katz experiment: he asks men and women what they do daily to avoid
                being sexually assaulted. For women, the list begins with, “Hold my keys as a potential weapon, check
                the back seat before I get in the car, don’t drink too much, don’t leave my drink unattended, carry
                mace, don’t have a listed number […]” and continues seemingly indefinitely. While for men, this isn’t
                something they think about; their go-to answer was, “<em>Nothing</em>.”</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>For men, sexual assault isn’t something they think about. Their go-to for avoiding harassment:
                    “<em>Nothing</em>.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We knew that it was important to look at the problem of virtual reality harassment from our unique
                perspective as women in VR, and we started by looking at consent language. Having written our paper in
                the year of #MeToo, we had a lot of consent-focused debate in the media to take inspiration from.</p>
            <p>We started with primary definitions of consent, such as, “all people should have complete ownership of
                their bodies and any interactions that should occur to them,” a quote from Jaclyn Friedman and Jessica
                Valenti’s <em>Yes Means Yes!: Visions of Female Sexual Power and A World Without Rape</em> (Berkeley:
                Seal Press). We grew that practice into looking at body sovereignty and ownership as an interactive
                principle to ensure safe, inclusive social VR spaces and help maintain a healthy virtual embodiment.</p>
            <h3 id="4a37"><strong>Fostering safety in virtual spaces</strong></h3>
            <p>Well, that’s all well and good, but how do we — as designers — bring consent, body sovereignty, and
                respect into the virtual world? By empowering people with easy-to-understand social norms, accessible
                tools, and appropriate behavior engagement. Our theory was that we could develop these features by
                looking for consent-acquisition paradigms in the real world and proposing virtual equivalents.</p>
            <p>To begin this process of digitizing consent, we knew it would be critical to understand how people
                perceive appropriate behaviors in the real world. In our day-to-day lives, there is etiquette in how we
                interact with people. You don’t wear your pajamas in public. You don’t skip the line or cut somebody off
                in traffic. And, if this does happen you can take action to stop that behavior. VR has very similar
                social modalities to what we experience in our real lives but, because VR is such a nascent format, the
                social norms we experience in reality have yet to be applied. In order to bring equity to VR would would
                have to pull in real world conduct expectations.</p>
            <p>So, to create codes of conduct for VR, we looked to the factors that make up our real-world environments.
                <em>Proxemics</em> — a term coined by anthropologist Edward T. Hall — refers to the relationship between
                your identity, your surroundings, and the social norms of the community around you. Hall divides
                experiences into zones of distance from the body.
            </p>

                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="3072983111058830729">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="3072983111058830729"><span class="marginnote"><em>Diagram:
                        Illustration of Edward T. Hall’s Zones of Interpersonal Space</em></span></figure>
            <p>Proxemics can be viewed as four distinct categories: intimate, personal, social, and public. The
                boundaries of these zones help us understand appropriacy at various distances. In the real world, each
                zone has an established code of conduct that offers explicit rules for what behaviors are acceptable and
                unacceptable. We can use these zones to help people understand what behavior is appropriate at specific
                times and locations.</p>
            <p>Using proxemics as a spatial scale, we can define explicit structures for behavior expectations and build
                natural boundaries in virtual social relationships. In separating these regions, we’re able look at
                consent acquisition models unique to each and provide VR equivalents, cumulatively building an
                infrastructure for virtual safety. This results in inspiration for consent introspection, tailored to
                each zone — the architecture of our code of conduct.</p>
            <p>As we go through each zone, we will accompany our inclusive design suggestions with examples from various
                social VR experiences.</p>
            <h3 id="b7a5"><strong>Intimate space</strong></h3>
            <p>Let’s begin with the nearest zone: intimate space. In the real world, an example of this would be a
                bedroom. To build safety in intimate <em>virtual</em> spaces, we suggest designers build
                <strong>granular controls</strong> that are easy to access and <strong>surfaced before intimate
                    interactions begin</strong>. It’s important that people can customize and control the types of
                experiences they’re willing to have with other people in these close quarters before they happen.
            </p>
            <p>The inspiration for this comes from the real-world intimate consent paradigms found in “Yes, No, Maybe”
                charts. These are procedures — often used by the BDSM community — in which individuals may list all
                intimate acts imaginable and categorize them into (1) experiences they would enjoy, (2) experiences they
                don’t ever want, and (3) experiences they’re not sure about. These individuals would then share these
                lists with each other before engaging in any precarious intimate acts.</p>
            <p>In VR, we can empower people by allowing them to define their ideal experience up front, to avoid
                violation in their digital intimate space. Our example here is from Rec Room, and shows granular
                controls for interactions within the Experiences tab of the Settings panel. This dialog allows people to
                define how close other users can get to them by setting the parameters of their personal safety bubble
                before any interaction happens.</p>

                        Room</strong><em> Settings Panel</em></span></figure>
            <h3 id="067e"><strong>Personal space</strong></h3>
            <p>Next, let’s look at personal space. In the real world, an example would be a living room or other shared
                household space.</p>
            <p>To build safety into virtual personal spaces, we can look at how medical practices negotiate consent
                through nonverbal cues. Specifically, we took our inspiration from the way the National Institute of
                Health secures ongoing consent from deaf participants in clinical trials using universal gestures.
                Designers should incorporate <strong>simple communication gestures and easy-access shortcuts</strong> to
                allow their users <strong>quick-action remediation</strong> in tough situations. These simple shortcuts
                can allow users to quickly report a problematic experience without interrupting or further degrading
                their experience.</p>
            <p>We designed the upcoming <em>Facebook Horizon</em> with easy-to-access shortcuts for moments when people
                would need quick-action remediation in tough situations. A one-touch button can quickly remove you from
                a situation. You simply touch the button and you land in a space where you can take a break and access
                your controls to adjust your experience.</p>

            <h3 id="7b81"><strong>Social space</strong></h3>
            <p>In the real world, an example of a social space could be a college campus. To make social virtual spaces
                safer, we can refer to the unspoken conduct agreements that keep interactions appropriate in specific
                environments.</p>
            <p>We looked at the rules sets created by colleges to prevent on-campus assault, and how the campuses needed
                to be explicit for reinforcement of these rules. Designers can introduce <strong>local behavior
                    expectations</strong> in VR social spaces by creating <strong>conduct codes customized to the
                    activities of the space</strong> and weaving them into the fabric of the space.</p>
            <p>Our example of local behavior codes is from the [now-defunct] social VR app, <em>Facebook Spaces</em>. As
                people entered a room that belonged to a specific <em>Facebook</em> group, we set expectations for
                conduct in this space with these rules. Designers can reinforce these sorts of local behavior
                expectations by administering rewards to users who uphold the rules or report violators.</p>

            <h3 id="597a"><strong>Public space</strong></h3>
            <p>And finally, public spaces. In the real world, a great example of a public space could be a public park
                or an entire city; any place in which you could potentially meet any kind of person. To ensure
                inclusivity in public virtual spaces, we can look to real-world law systems for inspiration.
                Specifically the real-world’s definitions of consent, evaluations of public behavior violations, and
                criminal consequences. We should consider comparably <strong>universal rules and persistent
                    consequences</strong> for virtual violation and harassment.</p>
            <p>For example, VRChat created a universal system (across all their worlds) that defines appropriacy and
                allows people to report offensive behavior. By pushing timely consequences to violators, these systems
                reinforce conduct expectations.</p>

            <p>As VR designers, we hold the unique opportunity to imagine worlds unbound by reality’s constraints. When
                approaching the responsibility of constructing new social environments — regardless of how surreal they
                may be — we should remind ourselves to treat virtual embodiment with the same respect given to physical
                bodies. Even if the real reality we inhabit often fails to do so.</p>
            <p>It is our responsibility to design innately safe virtual spaces and interactions, laying the groundwork
                for a future of inclusive, secure and empowering VR communities.</p>
            <p><em>A safe future is in our virtual hands.</em></p>
