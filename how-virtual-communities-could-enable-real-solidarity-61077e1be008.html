            <p>As a period of escalating political dissent looms, activists, journalists, and the communities they
                engage are looking to digital tools to widen the reach and impact of their message. Whether via the
                immediacy of live streaming, the immersion of 360 video, or the network effects of social media, digital
                platforms offer possibilities for creating virtual communities around real issues. But it’s worth
                revisiting the question of whether the likes of Periscope, Facebook, or Twitter serve as a basis for
                genuine solidarity.</p>
            <p>Many of those facing the militarized police in Standing Rock were moved to action as a result of an
                increasingly scandalous narrative carried <a
                    href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/12/media-report-standing-rock-161214101627199.html">primarily</a>
                on social media. Videos streamed from the front lines — both from <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/DigitalSmokeSignals/videos/10155475554189746/">activists</a> and
                independent journalists, such as <em>Democracy Now!’s</em> <a

                    shared</a> them in collective outrage. By the same token, when a man <a

                    a rifle</a> inside a Washington D.C. pizza restaurant in November, he was emerging from the tail end
                of what amounted to a <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/transmedia-what-15edf6b61daa#.ew43mxcxo">transmedia</a> fantasy
                narrative, given life among platforms such as Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, myriad comment threads and
                so-called fake news sites, reinforced within the feedback loops that our social feeds <a
                    href="http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/">have become</a>.</p>
            <p>For better or worse, the multimedia, multimodal nature of today’s various digital platforms have shown
                incredible power to inspire, organize, and motivate people in the real world. Can this capacity be put
                to better use in supporting communities standing up to injustice or abuse?</p>
            <h3 id="1541">Putting networks to work</h3>
            <p>During Brazil’s 2013 Vinegar Protests, Filipe Peçanha, member of the citizen journalism collective known
                as <a href="https://twitter.com/midianinja?lang=en">Mídia Ninja</a>, live streamed his own arrest to
                some 5,000 people. News of the event spread fast and mobilized crowds to surround the police station
                where he was being detained. According to Peçanha, the police heard the roar of the crowd from deep
                within the station.</p>
            <p>“They didn’t understand that it is not a camera, not a reporter,” Peçanha <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/midiaNINJA/posts/207055739452579">said</a> afterwards, “This is a
                network.”</p>

            <p>Such events offer compelling evidence that the connective, organizing potential of digital platforms can
                offer new and powerful means of engagement between concerned citizens and the issues that concern them.
                A mass of witnesses connected via live streaming video can indeed make their presence felt on the other
                side of the screen.</p>

                    Us</a>, a project of activism innovation nonprofit <a
                    href="https://witness.org/portfolio_page/sam-gregory/">WITNESS</a>, explores how the organizing
                power of networks and the experiential impact of real-time, immersive media might be wielded on the
                front lines of activism.</p>
            <p>One of their ideas is making the number of viewers for a livestreamed protest, vote, or negotiation
                visible to those being filmed. They also suggest an “Assembled Action” workflow, stringing together
                Google calendars, Meerkat livestreams, Twitter, and <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> applets —
                ‘if-then’ commands that integrate with and trigger a variety of services. Together, they could form a
                dynamic, automatic alert system that contacts and mobilizes people in real time based on their
                particular expertise for specific circumstances.</p>

            <p>Technology already makes connecting distant viewers to a critical event in real-time and in rich detail
                an easy feat. You can <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/livemap/#@40.67845153808601,-73.92656707763702,4z">browse a map</a>
                of the world and decide where and what to watch. If only you could then engage in more ways than simply
                observing, sharing or donating money.</p>
            <p>“A fair amount of activism is about this intense experience we share as participants,” says Sam Gregory,
                program director at WITNESS. “But a lot of the way we try and motivate people is still quite abstract.
                We send an email saying ‘try and feel what it’s like to be this person who suffered X,’ and then we ask
                people to participate in a fairly generic action. It’s unlikely that the best use of anyone’s time is
                donating ten bucks or clicking something.”</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Forget haptics — this is about making something <em>happen</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>What if there were pre-existing channels offering qualified viewers of a police confrontation the chance
                to contribute legal advice, or real-time translation, to report what’s occurring to local civil rights
                organizations, all the while knowing that they could contribute more if they wanted to? Deepening the
                capacity for making a difference could draw more people in, and would be felt more acutely on the other
                side of the screen.</p>
            <p>Forget haptics—this is about making something <em>happen</em>. Through networked platforms, there is a
                range of possible engagement that could redefine the term “<a

            <p>This all points to a mode of digitally mediated interaction dubbed <a
                    href="https://blog.witness.org/2015/10/see-hear-act-co-present-storytelling-and-action/">co-presence</a>.
                Through live streaming, video chat, and 360 video (which can also be <a
                    href="https://www.periscope.tv/w/1YqGoEZpebyxv">streamed live</a>) we get whiffs of co-presence.
                It’s distinct from telepresence in that not only does one feel, sensorily, that they are sharing a space
                with someone, but also that they are enabled to participate directly, in ways that transcend what’s
                possible in person. Rather than sharing a moment, even if virtually, you’re also sharing an object of
                action. This is related to what the <a
                    href="http://www.iftf.org/future-now/article-detail/from-telepresence-to-copresence/">Institute for
                    the Future</a> calls “attentional proximity.” According to the IFTF the technology is already here,
                all that’s missing is the plan for leveraging digital platforms to support these kinds of interactions.
            </p>
            <p>One’s body is its own form of invaluable, non-counterfeitable civic currency, but it’s not always
                available to offer. Yet our minds, skills, time and effort are also of great value and can be invested
                in many new ways thanks to digital tools. The devices in our pockets and on our desks afford us windows
                to the world. What’s needed are ways of reaching through them to lend a hand.</p>
            <h3 id="0cbb">Engagement vs. involvement</h3>
            <p>While on trial for copyright infringement, Pirate Bay spokesman Peter Sunde was asked why he and his
                partners chafed at using the term ‘IRL’ — In Real Life — when recounting the story of how they met.</p>
            <p>“We don’t like that expression,” <a href="https://youtu.be/eTOKXCEwo_8?t=9m29s">he replied</a>. “We say
                AFK, Away From Keyboard. We think that the internet is for real.”</p>
            <p>No doubt, what is experienced and expressed online carries tangible consequences. Digital platforms <a
                    href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/books/review/how-an-egyptian-revolution-began-on-facebook.html">have
                    proven instrumental</a> in sparking movements that spill into the streets. But in theses cases the
                role of technology tends to recede as the ephemeral, emergent, fast-twitch connections give way to the
                grinding mechanics of analog organizing. Easy as it is to confuse new forms of media as revolutionary
                messages unto themselves, movements live or die on what happens <em>outside</em> of the screen.
                Solidarity is a commitment, not a gesture.</p>
            <p>“Most of the people who were marching in Egypt didn’t even have access to Facebook, yet it was called the
                Facebook Revolution,” says documentary filmmaker and sociologist of new media technologies <a
                    href="http://opendoclab.mit.edu/sandra-rodriguez">Sandra Rodriguez</a>. “If you follow the
                salesman’s pitch discourse, it becomes, ‘How can you use social media to make sure we have a political
                or social impact?’ Cinema, documentary, radio, even TV shows and music were really, really important in
                the social movements of the ’60s, but there’s no way you can prove it’s the TV that changed the social
                movements.”</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>At the end of the day, any form of solidarity pertains to something that happens in physical space
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>What’s real is what these mediums carry. Maximizing their strength as experience delivery systems or
                creating ever denser networks, while valuable, is not what will define their value as transmitters and
                amplifiers of solidarity. Indeed, quite small — but organized — groups of people have proven powerful
                agents of change over recent decades. As Bill McKibben <a
                    href="https://www.thenation.com/article/how-the-active-many-can-overcome-the-ruthless-few/">reminds
                    us</a>, no more than 1 percent of Americans ever participated in a civil-rights protest.</p>
            <p>McKibben goes so far as to describe peaceful protest itself as a <a
                    href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/technology">technology</a>, perhaps the most
                important of the 20th century. Protest is both medium and message. It’s a practical system for
                organizing people and directing their energy effectively. Accordingly, there’s something to learn about
                the movement-sustaining potential of digital platforms from peaceful protest.</p>
            <p>Protests are an invitation to take part in a larger movement, manifested. At their <a
                    href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/11/how-should-trump-protesters-organize-themselves.html">most
                    effective</a>, they are issue-focused and form-flexible, built around a principle of open inclusion
                and broad involvement (and, of course, nonviolence). Ideally, they offer opportunities for long-term,
                deepening commitment rather than seeking to cause maximum immediate impact. That’s not exactly <a
                    href="https://vimeo.com/65904419">the digital M.O.</a></p>

                    users can now interact with events in real time, as in the livestreamed police shooting of Philandro
                    Castile</span></figure>
            <p>The Black Lives Matter movement offers another interesting example. BLM organizers managed to forge and
                maintain a relatively horizontal network across various social platforms — driven in large part to a
                surge of horrific videos of police violence in 2013 and 2014 carried by those very platforms — which has
                created a meaningful and shared sense of purpose among those who identify with the movement. However, on
                the whole, the network simmers while smaller groups within the movement activate in response to <a
                    href="http://wjla.com/news/local/black-lives-matter-protest-at-swearing-in-ceremony-of-dc-council-members">specific,
                    local issues</a>. Standing with gives way to standing beside.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, any form of solidarity pertains to something that happens in physical space — a
                lack of food or clean water, beatings or killings perpetrated by state power, a lack of jobs or the
                theft of resources, and so on. While there are many interesting technical possibilities for providing
                material, moral and other forms of support through networked devices, lasting community, accountability,
                and therefore solidarity are generated where people meet face-to-face. The opposite form of
                unaccountable solidarity looks something like a sea of Pepe the Frog avatars. Trying to mobilize such a
                community IRL — sorry, AFK — can <a
                    href="http://www.npr.org/2017/01/01/507395282/alt-right-infighting-simmers-around-inaugural-deploraball">get
                    messy</a>.</p>
            <p>Productively channeling the emotional heft of something like Standing Rock — to which most people could
                not contribute more than what was available on their screens — requires offering ways for people to
                participate and feel directly invested in the issue. That means striking a balance between the larger
                movement and particular issues which people can actually (as in physically) reach.</p>
            <p>What if instead of suggesting thematically related pages to distraught viewers of distant abuses,
                Facebook connected them to protests scheduled to take place nearby them? Or directed them to their
                representatives’ inboxes, and provided names and addresses of local advocacy organizations that need
                bodies?</p>
            <h3 id="b522">The revolution will not be Facetimed</h3>
            <p>Admittedly, this is unlikely. Facebook’s self-assigned mission after all is to <em>connect</em> the
                world, not correct it. Maybe that’s for the best, because <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/berniesanders/status/694243178833014784">real change doesn’t descend</a>
                from the synthetic hilltops of Silicon Valley, but from the grassroots up. Facebook and its ilk are
                probably more revolutionary in their capacity for <a

                    attention</a> and outrage than organizing and applying it productively to social ends. And anyway

                by the platform owners. Such bounding of permitted speech is pretty much exactly what protest is
                designed to subvert and rebuke. These compressed expressions of support or outrage may be less like the

            <p>Breaking out of the strictures imposed by platform owners is key to their use as tools of genuine
                solidarity and revolution. Small groups of people demonstrate that <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Streets-Chicago-Preface-Author/dp/0674197259">democracy is in
                    the streets</a> by seizing them in peaceful protest, to great effect. So too can they seize the
                formidable power of networks and digital platforms for themselves.</p>
            <p>There is great potential in <a
                    href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/gotenna-mesh-networking-for-smartphones">mesh networks</a>,
                for example. Comprised of local, line-of-site connections, they allow communities to operate and define
                their own telecommunications infrastructure. This offers communities greater agency and control over the
                very means by which they communicate. <a

                    use a corporate-owned telecom</a> to talk to your neighbor anyway when you can build and use your
                own, more resilient network?</p>
            <p>In New York City, in preparation for Trump’s America, rapid response networks are forming to direct aid
                to those who would prefer not to call the authorities — whether for domestic or racial violence, <a

                    raids</a>, basic medical needs, and so on. Small groups of citizens are building their own operator
                networks, using cell phones, anonymized and encrypted IRC and group chat platforms, and other tools,
                while providing training for first aid and self-defense. Though smaller in scope, they offer a more
                reassuring network for those in need of solidarity and support than anything funded by venture capital.

            <p>All of this is not to say<strong> </strong>that there is no role for what seem like small, even
                meaningless gestures enabled by the gargantuan digital platforms. Everything fits within a spectrum of
                engagement.</p>
            <p>“I’m not dismissive at all of what people think of as clicktivism, things like turning your Facebook
                profile pic a different color, or signing in at Standing Rock, because they’re simple ways in which you
                can start to participate,” says Gregory from WITNESS.</p>

                    Arnstein’s Ladder of Participation</span></figure>
            <p>“It’s a classic activism idea of the <a
                    href="http://lithgow-schmidt.dk/sherry-arnstein/ladder-of-citizen-participation.html">ladder of
                    participation</a>. In some ways we’ve stunted that ladder in a lot of online activism by making it
                very basic, not really providing enough steps up, and not making it very experientially connecting. That
                connection is really important if we do it right, to feel closer to frontline communities, to stand in
                solidarity. That’s not the same as having empathy or pity. It’s the idea that, particularly using these
                forms, it’s possible to stand <em>with</em> people, not just take actions <em>for</em> people.”</p>
            <p>Technology can and should reduce the impediments to those far from a front line who wish to contribute
                more than cash or a floating thumbs up. Real-time, immersive media can connect people to an issue in
                more personal, visceral ways. Networked platforms can channel that connection into a number of
                productive ends in real time. People can build their own networks and tools on what is now a ubiquitous
                range of devices and platforms.</p>
            <p>There is much potential for encouraging lasting and meaningful forms of solidarity on digital platforms.
                But any technology will only be as effective in generating change as the movement it channels.</p>
