            <p>Augmented Reality (AR) has become increasingly common across retail, gaming and the arts, and yet it
                still frequently falls into the “emerging technology” category. Though it has been widely tested, AR
                still has an aura of novelty and still faces a range of kinks to be worked out as it proliferates in new
                contexts and attracts fresh users.</p>
            <p>In late summer 2022, the Minnesota Twins baseball team joined the world of augmented reality with the
                launch of the<a href="https://aroundar.com/download"> ARound Stadium app</a>. Developed for use during a
                baseball game and inside the stadium, the app includes a handful of short games as well as interactive
                features. Three of us from <a href="https://8bridgesworkshop.com/">8 Bridges Workshop</a> attended a
                Twins game in September to try out the app and see whether it holds promise as a model for live
                performing arts. We explored what kinds of experiences AR could bring to sports audiences, and what
                elements might translate to other live entertainment venues.</p>
            <p>ARound joins a portfolio of apps in which Major League Baseball has invested heavily, <a
                    href="https://www.mlb.com/apps/mlb-app">MLB </a>and <a
                    href="https://www.mlb.com/apps/ballpark">Ballpark</a>. MLB is a subscription-based app that has all
                teams’ schedules and results, deep information about players and their stats, links to access local TV
                and radio broadcasts and a sophisticated play-by-play simulation called <a
                    href="https://www.mlb.com/schedule/gameday">GameDay </a>that you can watch live for any baseball
                game at any time. The Ballpark app allows users to pre-order food and drink, purchase tickets, and find
                parking options, among other features.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>What did we find? With the ARound app installed, and your phone’s camera pointed toward the playing
                field, games dominate. You can knock down towers of blocks, go fishing or try to hit a baseball. Other
                interactive elements allow users to share emojis, see icons indicating that other app users are in the
                stands and throw virtual items such as donuts, hot dogs, and beach balls onto the virtual field for no
                particular reason other than fun.</p>
            <p>The lighthearted cartoon graphics and brief games seem geared toward an audience of kids needing a
                distraction from the at-times slow-moving pace of baseball. While spokespersons have<a
                    href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2022/08/23/minnesota-twins-launch-first-shared-ar-for-live-sports-app-that-opens-door-to-sponsorship-land-grab/?sh=61373c836ddc">
                    ruminated about expanded uses</a>, such as showcasing player stats, the current app is largely
                unrelated to action on the field. In fact, ARound’s interactives obscure the field and it is even easy
                to forget that a game is underway. Such features might be useful for entertaining bored children (or
                adults), serving a similar purpose to the many major league play-pens and interactive installations, but
                the disconnect seems strange, as opportunities to teach about baseball or draw fans and new audiences
                closer to the action are lost when the game on the field becomes a secondary background for the app’s
                antics.</p>

            </figure>
            <h3 id="1ab9"><strong>Ahead of and behind the times?</strong></h3>
            <p>This disconnect may be just a matter of getting something new up and running. The app has<a
                    href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2022/08/23/minnesota-twins-launch-first-shared-ar-for-live-sports-app-that-opens-door-to-sponsorship-land-grab/?sh=61373c836ddc">
                    been touted as likely the “first shared augmented reality application for live sports.”</a> Yet
                there looks to be a need for stadiums and teams to catch up to the kind of technology integration that
                baseball fans and gamers will expect.</p>
            <p>Also, if users want to be active on the app throughout an entire baseball game, they will need a way to
                charge their phones. (Our batteries quickly drained.) This also begs the question of how to develop
                content that could hold a fan’s interest throughout the game, rather than quickly running its course.
                The app does not gather user data, but next stages are likely to include ways to monetize interaction,
                potentially through in-app purchases or featured sponsors.</p>
            <p>ARound’s launch comes in the midst of an overall drop in MLB ticket sales. The pandemic has dealt a major
                blow to habits of going out, and bolstered entertainment options from home. <a
                    href="https://www.axios.com/local/twin-cities/2022/08/24/minnesota-twins-augmented-reality-app">Axios</a>
                linked the app to other efforts by Major League Baseball and teams to both reenergize existing fans and
                draw in new audiences. But in the context of this pandemic slump, aren’t the fans and families who still
                show up already engaged?</p>
            <p>It seems that those who physically make the trek to the stadium may really want to follow the action on
                the field, particularly on fall weeknights (like the game we attended) with school or work the next day.
                This raises the question of what baseball pilgrims still devoted to in-person attendance may want from
                an app. The answer could be many things: a chance to connect with fellow fans, detailed information
                about players and history, or, when kids lose interest, possibly a game that totally blots out the
                field.</p>

            <h3 id="4125"><strong>How does an augmented reality feel?</strong></h3>
            <p>So, when does AR live up to its name? When does it truly augment experience by enriching a connection to
                place or to other people? When does it draw us in — facilitating a deeper experience of an unfolding
                moment — and when does it distract or disconnect us from the world that surrounds us?</p>
            <p>In its possibilities and pitfalls, ARound offers a number of lessons and questions for documentarians to
                ponder. When devising an AR experience, how might it draw people into a deeper engagement with place and
                context? How can it connect people, both those who know each other and passersby who find themselves in
                a shared experience? How can it help users to better notice, across senses and emotions, what is
                happening or present in a place?</p>
            <p>This is not to suggest that AR needs to take on a serious tone. Different forms of attention are not
                inherently wrong. Storytellers regularly guide the flow of audiences’ experiences, orchestrating style,
                media, and momentum to convey narrative and elicit emotion. In terms of AR, some places are marked by
                painful histories that resonate today. Grappling with these pasts can require a range of methods of
                curating attention, at times leaning into hard truths, at times stepping back. What matters is therefore
                not a hierarchy of forms of attention but rather a question of goals and audience. What are you trying
                to achieve and who is it for?</p>
            <p>Sometimes, distraction can be a worthwhile goal. But, if distraction is the aim, why would someone engage
                with particular AR content rather than any number of other apps or options? ARound will need more
                features to keep us distracted in more satisfying ways or more content related to the game-at-hand to
                keep us engaged. Still, knowing that sports teams are working on such projects should cause artists and
                cultural organizations to take note. How might the cultural sector show a way forward instead of
                trailing commercial experiments? How might we engage and immerse, rather than distract our audiences?
