                rights and freedoms and the values of justice to be a top priority. They lauded actions like those of
                the Silicon Valley employees who left their jobs to launch the <a href="http://humanetech.com/">Center
                    for Humane Technology</a> to counter practices such as addictive design in interactive and social
                media, and praised research and watchdog organizations such as <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/">AI

                practices that center those who stand to be most adversely impacted by design decisions in design
                processes… to challenge the ways that design and designers harm Indigenous peoples, communities of
                color, poor and working class people, the sick and disabled, migrants, LGBTQ people, women and femmes…
                to imagine and build the world we need to live in — one that is safe and just.”</p>

            <p>They have created a great foundation for how to do this kind of design, which adheres to the following
                set of <a href="http://designjusticenetwork.org/network-principles/">design principles</a>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>We use design to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as well as to seek liberation from
                        exploitative and oppressive systems.</em></li>
                <li><em>We center the voices of those who are directly impacted by the outcomes of the design
                        process.</em></li>
                <li><em>We prioritize design’s impact on the community over the intentions of the designer.</em></li>
                <li><em>We view change as emergent from an accountable, accessible, and collaborative process, rather
                        than as a point at the end of a process.</em></li>
                <li><em>We see the role of the designer as a facilitator rather than an expert.</em></li>
                <li><em>We believe that everyone is an expert based on their own lived experience, and that we all have
                        unique and brilliant contributions to bring to a design process.</em></li>
                <li><em>We share design knowledge and tools with our communities.</em></li>
                <li><em>We work towards sustainable, community-led and -controlled outcomes.</em></li>
                <li><em>We work towards non-exploitative solutions that reconnect us to the earth and to each other</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Before seeking new design solutions, we look for what is already working at the community level.
                        We honor and uplift traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge and practices.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Similarly, Jamie Williams and Lena Gunn, who write for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, ask us to
                pause on the relentless design trend to <a
                    href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/math-cant-solve-everything-questions-we-need-be-asking-deciding-algorithm-answer">solve
                    everything with an algorithm</a>, perhaps at the expense of well-being and better solutions. They
                point out a set of questions that everyone participating in the design of code should ask when designing
                technology to mitigate the negative ramifications of an algorithm gone wrong, as in Indiana’s welfare
                system algorithm that led to a child’s death; or how bias data erroneously racialized the prediction of
                child abuse the department of Children, Youth and Families (CYF) in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.</p>

            <p>The issues raised in the <em><a
                        href="https://makinganewreality.org/minorities-in-majority-spaces-8728c8687db8">Minorities in
                        Majority Spaces</a></em> article last month are very complex and dynamic, with no easy answers
                for resolving the concerns. It will really take a deep education in our society, the elimination of
                unjust biases, and an ongoing process of developing genuine and authentic intersectional friendships and
                respectful working relationships before we see a decrease in “othering” and distrust.</p>
            <p>However, there are a few principles that interviewees and researchers identified that build on and echo
                the Design Justice Network’s ideas for people working to create inclusive, safe, productive and
                equitable spaces:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>take an iterative approach to the ongoing process of your group, project, organization, or community
                    development;</li>
                <li>communicate expectations clearly;</li>
                <li>establish protocols of participants to feel welcomed to express their thoughts and ideas, as well as
                    raise any red flags that might hinder participation;</li>
                <li>allow people to set appropriate boundaries around their participation and engagement (i.e. ability
                    to opt out of triggering processes);</li>
                <li>listen deeply;</li>
                <li>be aware of the dynamics of power and privilege, so you can help mitigate their impact on equity;
                </li>
                <li>consult on resolutions; adjust the design or process as needed;</li>
                <li>and check-in and reflect on the process or environment dynamics again.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to these principles, we are seeing a growing use of legal instruments that require justice to
                be designed into the process of innovation or development. For example, many communities are adopting
                the <a
                    href="http://www.chicagoreporter.com/how-neighborhoods-have-held-developers-accountable-to-their-needs/">Community
                    Benefits Agreements</a> that prohibit purely extractive relationships between entities and
                communities, or <a
                    href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/05/590867132/whats-an-inclusion-rider-here-s-the-story-behind-frances-mcdormand-s-closing-wor">Inclusion
                    Riders</a> or <a

                    Nations</a> contracts that aim to mitigate inequities in the entertainment industries.</p>
            <p><strong>Setting a clear mission and boundaries: One maker’s perspective</strong></p>
            <p>Filmmaker and activist, Sabaah Folayan, brought many of these ideas to this research. She had an
                insightful reflection on the need to engage in active communication about boundaries and expectations to
                achieve inclusion, noting “it is a matter of setting boundaries and requesting that expectations be made
                clear, knowing that we live in a world where most are conditioned to see black people setting boundaries
                as an act of hostility. In some cases, our attempts to set boundaries are met with responses ranging
                from anger and denial to tears over a perceived ‘attack,’ regardless of how calmly and kindly we
                approach the situation.” Being able to put one’s ego and defensive reflexes aside, calm the
                fight-or-flight instinct, and really listen, is critical for anyone working to be a part of an inclusive
                space (although it ain’t easy…and we are likely going to fail every once in a while). Folayan explained
                that “For white people whose physical well-being is not bound up in the eradication of white supremacy,
                this is most critical. They must be the ones to silence their visceral emotions and truly hear us, for
                those emotions are typically based on deep seated racial conditioning and an incomplete understanding of
                the reality we all share.”</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/375/0*GZAy24ZL4WT-DDaB." width="800"><label

                        and activist Sabaah Folayan</a></span></figure>
            <p>Folyan also states that it is important to be clear about the mission and expectations that an
                organization or organizer has of everyone participating in a process. This will allow people to
                negotiate adjustments and set personal boundaries ahead of active participation, as well as opt-in to
                the emotional, mental and physical labor involved in the process — or opt-out, if necessary. She
                reflected on Sundance Institute’s “standing commitment to diversifying racial perspectives in
                documentary” and said that its overt mission statement helps her and her collaborator, Damon Davis, move
                through some of the issues that have come up in the process of the increasing inclusion. These moments
                are critical in learning how to relate to one another in a fair and equitable way. I’ve had other
                experiences where there is not such an explicit mission statement, where the majority of the organizers
                do not have an active personal practice of deconstructing their conditioned behaviors, and in those
                instances addressing such problems becomes a lot more complicated.”</p>
            <p>Folayan highlighted the need to always check the dynamics of your power and privilege, even as a person
                of color or member of a traditionally marginalized group. “Racism is an issue of life and death.
                Disparities affect healthcare outcomes, policing, environmental safety and every other area you can
                think of. It’s important to keep in perspective that those of us who have the privilege of making art,
                especially in such an expensive medium…who are privileged to be able to intellectualize these stories
                from a creative distance, need to recognize that privilege. We need to be bolder and more courageous in
                our conversations.”</p>
            <p>I learned many years ago in grad school, in my consulting practice class, that setting clear terms and
                boundaries at the start of a relationship, may feel uncomfortable, but it is actually the greatest tool
                for securing long-term unity in any partnership or collaboration. Folayan reminds me of that principle
                when she says what might be perceived as “being difficult” is actually an attempt “within a silo, and
                without much leverage, to enact new patterns of interracial collaboration by refusing to submit to the
                idea that setting boundaries is an act of hostility, by refusing to cater to white fragility.” This is
                the hard work of moving equity, justice and unity further.</p>
            <p>As the Detroit Narrative Agency so eloquently discussed in their response piece to the <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/the-radical-opportunity-4584ed4601fd">Radical Opportunity</a>
                article, designing for justice <a href="https://immerse.news/begin-by-listening-ce8a0f9adfea">starts
                    with listening</a> — something Folayan calls for here.</p>
            <p>This concept is not a new one. <a
                    href="https://www.asee.org/public/conferences/32/papers/10351/download">American Society for
                    Engineering Education</a> published a paper called “What is designing for social justice?” in 2014
                and it explicitly called for listening: “Although multiple stakeholders can play important roles, the
                dominant relationship is between community members and designers from engineering and other disciplines,
                informed by and seeking to enact social justice. In addition to listening to the local context,
                designers are challenged to listen to the structural conditions that gave rise to inequalities,
                including those that exist beyond the local context. That form of listening enables multidisciplinary
                design teams to broadly define the problem and propose solutions that attempt to increase human rights,
                opportunities, and resources, while reducing imposed risks and harms, all in order to enhance human
                capabilities.”</p>
            <p>Finally, Folayan also prompts us to invert the perspective that increasing inclusion even means
                increasing minorities in majority spaces, when, especially in the case of “people of color,” you can
                expand the aperture to see the reality that the “minority” is the majority. She states that “many of our
                most acclaimed films feature people of color from around the globe, yet we limit our perspective to
                national boundaries when discussing authorship/defining who is a minority vs. a majority.” Folayan and
                Davis say they are “refusing to uphold the idea that we are a ‘minority’ when, in fact, we are part of
                an expansive diaspora which comprises a global majority.” I know it may be unprofessional, as this is a
                research paper, but <em>Yes!</em> She just helped me to re-evaluate my patterns of thinking that

            <p>During the opening session of Sundance Institute’s <a
                    href="https://www.sundance.org/blogs/designing-the-future-of-work-new-frontier-world-building-residency-in-los-angeles#/">2017
                    New Frontier World Building Residency</a> at USC, we all had to answer the question “What job to you
                want to have in 2037?” My colleague Ruthie Doyle answered that she wanted to work for the organization
                focused on measuring the well-being of the world and designing for improving the world’s well-being. She
                imagined <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/01/the-economics-of-well-being">a well-being Index would replace
                    the GDP as a countries top economic indicator of prosperity</a>. This would be a more robust and
                critical economic and policy engine, than the <a href="http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/">current
                    indices and reports</a> that measure happiness.</p>

            <p>What would Doyle’s future work involve? Well, Philip Brey, a philosophy of technology professor at the
                University of Twente, discusses four design approaches that aim for creating greater human well-being in
                technology:</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GKIYD4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Emotional
                    Design</a> — a family of approaches that use design to evoke emotional experiences such as pleasure
                and other positive emotions. Patrick Jordan expands on that idea of pleasure by categorizing them as
                Physio-pleasure (Bodily pleasure deriving from the sense organs), Psycho-pleasure (Pleasure deriving
                from cognitive and emotional reactions), Socio-pleasure (Pleasure arising from one’s relationship with
                other people or society as a whole), and Ideo-pleasure (Pleasure arising from people’s values and
                tastes: cultural and aesthetic values, moral values and personal aspirations).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/capability-approach/">Capability approaches to
                        design</a> — focuses on the enhancement of people’s basic capabilities for leading a good life.
                    It rests on the assumption that people’s ability to attain well-being is dependent on their
                    development and possession of a number of basic capabilities that allow them to engage in activities
                    that promote their well-being, which are opportunities to do things or be things that are of value
                    to them.</li>
                <li><a href="http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/a-design-approach-to-human-flourishing/">Positive psychology
                        approaches</a> — an approach that focuses on studying and improving people’s positive
                    functioning and well-being and focuses on the enhancement of creativity, talent and fulfillment. One
                    very influential theory in positive psychology is that authentic happiness or a good life is a
                    combination of three types of lives: the pleasant life, the engaged life and the meaningful life.

                        Design</a> — a design approach that aims to improve well-being by looking at people’s whole
                    lives and the role of technologies in them. Looking at whole lives involves studying people’s forms
                    of life, values, and circumstances, and taking these into account in design. A form of life is a
                    practice or “system of rule-following actions”, such as a hobby, activity, profession or family
                    role.</li>

            <p>The <a
                    href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/04/17/the-future-of-well-being-in-a-tech-saturated-world/">Pew
                    Research Center</a> recently asked experts in tech and psychology the question: “Over the next
                decade, how will changes in digital life impact people’s overall well-being physically and mentally?”
                Although a little under half of respondents felt that technology will bring more help than harm, there
                was still a significant amount of concern about the possibility of technology causing more harm than
                good. However, they did collect a number of recommendations for how we might mitigate the harm and
                further well-being. Here are those “potential remedies”:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em><strong>Reimagine systems:</strong></em> Societies can revise both tech arrangements and the
                    structure of human institutions — including their composition, design, goals and processes.</li>
                <li><em><strong>Reinvent tech:</strong></em> Things can change by reconfiguring hardware and software to
                    improve their human-centered performance and by exploiting tools such as artificial intelligence
                    (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR).</li>
                <li><em><strong>Regulate: </strong></em>Governments and/or industries should create reforms through
                    agreement on standards, guidelines, codes of conduct, and passage of laws and rules.</li>
                <li><em><strong>Redesign media literacy:</strong></em> Formally educate people of all ages about the <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIC1jqlXIbg&amp;feature=youtu.be">impacts of digital life
                        on well-being</a> and the way tech systems function, as well as encourage appropriate, healthy
                    uses.</li>
                <li><em><strong>Recalibrate expectations</strong></em>: Human-technology coevolution comes at a price;
                    digital life in the 2000s is no different. People must gradually evolve and adjust to these changes.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><em><strong>What about ethics?</strong></em></p>
            <p>Beyond the <a
                    href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/top-10-ethical-issues-in-artificial-intelligence/">nine
                    major areas of ethical dilemmas</a> the World Economic Forum has identified for us to consider as we
                design an AI integrated future, which have been discussed in previous articles, interviewees called for
                bringing some “home training” into cyberspace.</p>
            <p>There is a growing <a
                    href="https://everydaymentor.org/article/social-mediamedia-literacy-responsible-use/">set of
                    standards for educating youth</a> about responsible participation in social media and protecting
                themselves online. However, producer Lisa Osborne called for a broader standard of digital ethics that
                go further than just securing human rights. She believes we should identify behaviors that can be taught
                in schools that can help us create less toxic online environments. For example, when is it acceptable to
                take someone’s photo and post it on smart platforms?</p>

            <p>Also, how do we transparently rate platforms and content in emerging media, so consumers have greater
                control over what they consume? Some argue that this could be a matter of including this content in
                existing solutions, like<a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/"> Common Sense Media</a> or MPAA.
                However, some members of the sociology and the mental health professions feel that there is not enough
                empirical data on how these new media platforms impact our brains and behaviors to create appropriate
                rating systems. Related suggestions include developing robust<a

            <p>Journalist and blogger Lindsey West lifted the veil on the psychological dynamics of troll and
                cyber-bully behavior when she confronted one of her cruelest trolls and he share with her his own
                unhappiness and low self-esteem. (Read <a

                    mental health systems</a> and a need for deeper, more enriching, community engagement. One of the
                solutions might be a cross-pollination of mental health professionals and developers in the design
                process. Designing for mental health could be a critical way of mitigating these underlying pathologies.

            <p>As Joe Unger of Pigeon Hole Productions pointed out, LA-based Riot’s <em>League of Legends</em> is a game
                with hundreds of millions in their fan-base. It was the first gaming company to hire sociologists and
                ethicists to create an in-game, user-driven justice system. Homophobia, sexism, and racism were reduced
                to 2% of all <em>League of Legends</em> matches. UCLA Law Professor Claudia Peña, Lecturer at UCLA
                School of Law, even suggested emerging media creators be trained in trauma-informed design practices:
                “Being ‘trauma-informed’ is one of the latest movements in the nonprofit sector. We’ve been developing
                curriculum to educate lawyers on how to be trauma-informed. It’s made progress in the field of medicine
                and social work, and it’s spreading to other industries. If we’re committed to not being stuck in siloed
                frames and wanting to reduce the possibility of harm, it would be helpful to think of VR creators as
                being trained in ‘trauma-informed’ programming or design.”</p>
            <p>Another important perspective to have in the design process for interactive and immersive media is how
                one’s design might impact one community very differently than it impacts another. How do the stressors
                that come with poverty, disrupted or displaced family structures, or disabilities affect the impact of
                media content?</p>
            <p>In a <em>New York Times</em> piece titled “<em><a
                        href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/opinion/america-digital-divide.html?emc=edit_th_180212&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=66694122&amp;referer=">America’s
                        Real Digital Divide</a></em>,” Naomi Schaefer Riley writes about “an initiative, called Truth
                About Tech, [which] aims to push these companies to make their products less addictive for children —
                and it’s a good start. But there’s more to the problem. If you think middle-class children are being
                harmed by too much screen time, just consider how much greater the damage is to minority and
                disadvantaged kids, who spend much more time in front of screens…While some parents in more dangerous
                neighborhoods understandably think that screen time is safer than playing outside, the deleterious
                effects of too much screen time are abundantly clear. Screen time has a negative effect on children’s
                ability to understand nonverbal emotional cues; it is linked to higher rates of mental illness,
                including depression; and it heightens the risk for obesity.” -</p>
            <p><em><strong>What is design prosperity?</strong></em></p>
            <p>An important point when making the case for design justice and design well-being is to note that these
                are synonymous with design prosperity.</p>
            <p>During one of my trips for <em>Making a New Reality, </em>a white woman, very dedicated to justice,
                asked, “How do we convince white people to give up their wealth and prosperity to share with others, so
                we can have more equitable and inclusive space?” I was struck by the premise, because I never even
                considered that establishing justice, equity, and inclusion meant that people that currently think they
                are benefiting from systems of injustice, inequality, and exclusion would have to lose anything (except
                unbridled power). I’ve always understood that “white people,” or those who are at the top of current
                systems of unjust power, were already operating in a severe deficit.</p>
            <p>By explicitly or implicitly perpetuating systems of oppression, we limit the body of humanity from
                accessing the majority of its potential. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are not a zero-sum proposition
                — they are actually strategies of sustainable abundance and well-being. We have been operating in an
                ecosystem that has critical parts of what makes it work extracted. When we design for the margins and
                for justice, we establish balance and allow everyone to benefit from the development of these latent
                human potentialities.</p>
