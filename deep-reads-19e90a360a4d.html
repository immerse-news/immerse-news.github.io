            <p><strong>How well does room-scale VR work?
                </strong><a href="http://www.mediaimpactproject.org/immersive.html">A study</a> by the Media Impact
                Project at USC Annenberg’s Norman Lear Center of two <em>FRONTLINE</em> productions found that
                room-scale VR was effective for creating a sense of spatial presence, and encouraging participants to
                focus on their own perspectives and experiences—although the novelty of the technology might distract
                users from absorbing complex information</p>
            <p><strong>Dissecting “immersive documentary encounters”
                </strong>A collaborative research project, <em><a href="http://vrdocumentaryencounters.co.uk/">Virtual
                        Realities</a></em><em> </em>brings together researchers from the University of the West of
                England, University of Bath and the University of Bristol to better understand how the social and
                cultural contexts of nonfiction VR might inform audiences’ experiences. Led by <a
                    href="http://i-docs.org/">i-Docs</a>’ Mandy Rose, this qualitative process will engage up to
                eighteen households from four communities to elicit responses from members of the general public, and to
                understand how VR consumption affects their activities and their media literacy.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Experience on Demand</strong></em><strong>
                </strong>The <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/978-0-393-25369-6/">latest book</a> by Jeremy
                Bailenson—the founding director of Stanford’s <a href="http://vhil.stanford.edu/">Virtual Human
                    Interaction Lab</a>—examines the psychological effects of virtual reality, and its potential for
                therapy, learning, fitness, creativity and more.,</p>
            <p><strong>Seven ways to build stories for social good
                </strong>Researchers at the University of Florida just launched <a
                    href="https://medium.com/science-of-story-building">this site</a>, packed with scholarship about how
                “brains work to <em>tell </em>stories that are more compelling, memorable, inspiring and likely to be
                re-told or shared,” and how “to <em>identify </em>stories that are likely to have meaning for those
                we’re trying to connect with.”</p>

            <p><strong>What can documentarians learn from journalists?
                </strong>Reporters and documentary makers face a lot of the same challenges: interviewing sometimes
                hostile subjects, checking facts, sifting through public records and more. Working with the University
                of Missouri’s Jonathan B. Murray Center for Documentary Journalism, the International Documentary
                Association has released this <a href="https://docjournalism.com/map/">useful guide</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Rising forms of networked journalism
                </strong>A <a href="https://towcenter.org/research/collaboration-a-new-journalism-commons/">report
                </a>by Columbia Tow Center fellow Carlos Marinez De La Serna describes emerging collaborative practices
                in journalism as a new journalistic commons. “Connecting news media to the vocabulary of the commons
                provides a rich framework to analyze the impact of networked forms of collaboration in reshaping the
                infrastructure for journalism.”</p>
