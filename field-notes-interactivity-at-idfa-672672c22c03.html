            <p><a href="https://www.doclab.org/">IDFA DocLab</a>, a premier showcase for interactive documentary, wound
                up another extraordinary event in mid-November, at the International Documentary Festival at Amsterdam.
                DocLab positions itself as a harbinger of artistic and technological trends in interactive documentary.
                This year it held a showcase of current projects attracting the attention of programmer Caspar Sonnen
                and his team, an annual conference, and a session on interactive preservation.</p>
            <h3 id="2340"><strong>Dark themes, powerful platforms</strong></h3>
            <p>Alarm and foreboding was notable among the interactive projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em><a
                            href="https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/01eeffc2-48fc-456e-832a-3c9e9311b9e2/limbo">Limbo</a></em><em>
                    </em>is<em> </em>a journey inside the nightmarish fear of an anonymous, generic asylum seeker.</li>
                <li><em><a href="https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/0c93980b-a15b-40fd-857a-958a4ebb04a6/greenland-melting">Greenland
                            Melting</a></em><em> </em>was FRONTLINE’s contribution to alarm and action on climate
                    change; you could take a high-tech VR trip to Greenland to watch the glaciers disappear before our
                    eyes. The VR experience ends with a scientist talking about how his scientific work is an inadequate
                    response to the urgency of the crisis, but all he can do. It’s a powerful and terrifying encounter
                    with the future, and a discreet but implicit call to action.</li>
                <li><em><a href="https://poppy.submarinechannel.com/">Poppy Interactive</a></em><em>,</em> a Dutch work
                    that reflects on years of Middle East reporting to terrifyingly connect the dots — literally —
                    between war, terrorism, and trade in drugs and guns. Visit it online, and get an X-ray of today’s
                    headlines. This is journalism adding up to a bigger picture over the years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Interactive artists concerned with social change continue to look for look for new ways to engage users
                and potential publics. Michèle Stephenson and Joe Brewster (<em>American Promise) </em>are working with
                Yasmin Elayat on a VR experience that’s a time-travel journey through the<strong> </strong>ongoing
                American experience of racial terror, using Bryan Stevenson’s words: “Slavery never ended, it has just
                evolved.” This is the first project of the <a
                    href="http://independent-magazine.org/2017/10/katerina-cizek-opening-documentary-mits-new-co-creative-studio/">Co-Creation
                    Studio</a> at the MIT Open Documentary Lab.<strong> </strong>They pitched to great interest at <a
                    href="https://www.idfa.nl/en/info/idfa-forum">the IDFA Forum</a>, which has recently included
                interactive projects. The Forum, grandmother of the now-common pitching event, is still a premier
                destination. Its inclusion of cross-platform media projects is a signal of their now-mainstream status.

            <h3 id="180a"><strong>Where are we now?</strong></h3>
            <p>The DocLab interactive conference used the well-known graphic of technological evolution to probe
                participants’ mood.</p>

            <p>Most thought they were struggling up from the trough of disillusionment, with a hangover, on the slope of
                enlightenment. But along with enlightenment comes obsolescence.</p>
            <p>Ingrid Kopp cried out at one point, “It’s discouraging to be told 360 is over when I’m still trying to
                figure out how to make it work in South Africa!” She received scant sympathy, but with good humor.</p>
            <h3 id="88d4"><strong>Analog, of course</strong></h3>
            <p>Apparently one way to escape disillusion in digital interactivity is to return to analog. Lauren McCarthy
                uses the <a href="https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/f7470951-0f39-491f-bb87-c348b0e65f24/lauren">Internet of
                    Things in her home</a> to give guests a remote experience of her high-touch help waking them up.
                (She won an award.) Comedian Micha Wertheim experimented with phoning his public performance in via
                robot, and found out that in-person is better. Old-fashioned IRL experience — walking around outdoors —
                was a key component of two interactive projects where an audio guide led users on <a
                    href="https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/c90c28df-eb56-4efb-8fc8-a179e1f4580a/i-swear-to-tell-the-truth">an
                    experience of fake news</a> and of <a
                    href="https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/11c79c93-3393-43a6-bae8-593e5829de52/it-must-have-been-dark-by-then">personal
                    mapmaking</a>.</p>
            <p>In a keynote presentation, data artist Jonathan Harris also struck an analog note. He gave a whirlwind
                tour of his career, which has involved a search for the meaning of life in places like the Internet. He
                described himself as “choreographing data,” and “looking for omens, following signs.” He has now decided
                that our bodies actually provide us naturally with virtual reality, and that life is the medium for art.
                He encouraged everyone to go outdoors.</p>
            <h3 id="3a93"><strong>Memory — oh, that</strong></h3>
            <p>Interactive documentary is now old enough to worry about its future. At IDFA DocLab’s Interactive
                Preservation meeting, which referenced last May’s <a
                    href="https://phi-centre.com/en/event/update-or-die/">Update or Die conference</a>, experts
                including <a href="https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>’s
                Erwin Verbruggen noted that interactive’s early generations have rarely been preserved at all. Indeed,
                VR currently is so difficult even to imagine being preserved it might not be a good candidate as
                archivists try to decide what to rescue.</p>
            <p>Deciding on preservation priorities was the big challenge of the group’s meeting. IDFA DocLab has already
                created a “<a href="https://www.doclab.org/100-2/">canon</a>” by identifying memorable interactive
                projects from its previous showcases. Participants did not, however, find in one morning a common set of
                values around which priorities could form.</p>
            <h3 id="2380"><strong>What’s it all for?</strong></h3>
            <p>What’s interactive for, anyway? Chinese artist Qi Zhao noted that in China there is little interest in
                projects that don’t draw tens of millions of viewers, and art projects in the area aren’t encouraged. So
                financing of VR or AR there is linked to practical concerns. His <em><a
                        href="https://www.idfa.nl/en/search?page=1&amp;q=the%20cave">The Cave</a></em><em> </em>takes
                viewers inside a rarely-seen Chinese cave where ancient Buddhist art decorates the walls. It was indeed
                an engaging and satisfying touristic experience.</p>
            <p>Lack of evidence and serious problems with accessibility (headsets! bandwidth!) are eating away at the
                promises of VR as an “empathy machine.” Interactive projects all suffer variously from the practical
                challenges of interactivity. For instance, <a
                    href="https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/5bbcfd7c-452e-4f60-91f8-fa5b00aa957d/bury-me-my-love">Bury Me, My
                    Love</a> could be a wrenching experience of the separation and anxiety when only one member of a
                couple manages to flee crisis, but it works only if the user can live with real-time delays of
                (pre-programmed) texting.</p>
            <p>South African legal activist Nurina Ally asked a pointed question about documentaries that was relevant
                in the interactive environment as well: “How do we move beyond empathy to build solidarity?”</p>
