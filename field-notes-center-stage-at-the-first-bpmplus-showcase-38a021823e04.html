            <h3 id="ed6d">A dispatch from the new VR/AR/XR section of Black Public Media’s annual PitchBLACK Forum</h3>
            <p>While my peers complain of Zoom fatigue and organizations hatch plans for getting back to a decidedly
                dysfunctional “normal,” I am fully appreciating my unprecedented access to just about everything as a
                result of the pandemic. Yes, it has been a year of online work and events for which my eyes, lower back,
                and social life have suffered. Still, I am not mad because online events have opened the world to me in
                ways that did not exist before quarantine.</p>
            <p>In-person iterations of film festivals, conferences, and forums are not always feasible for me. Thanks to
                pandemic-era norms of holding hybrid or virtual events, I have attended more conferences, film
                festivals, workshops, and classes this year than ever before, all while saving my vital resources. For
                many of us, the pandemic sparked deeper contemplation about what true access and representation look
                like in motion. Artists are tackling access-related challenges in their work with renewed vigor.</p>
            <p>Last month, <a href="https://blackpublicmedia.org/">Black Public Media’s</a> (BPM) inaugural BPMplus
                Showcase was the bright spot on my ever-growing roster of virtual events. Black Public Media is a
                non-profit organization that supports, develops, and distributes content that centers African American
                and global Black perspectives. Now in its fourth year, BPM’s PitchBLACK Forum is a competition for
                makers to secure funding to take their projects to the next level. This year, BPM awarded $410,000, the
                highest amount ever, to five creative teams competing in the Forum. I was able to attend the event for
                the first time thanks to the new online iteration. Prior to 2020, PitchBLACK was a physical event in New
                York City.</p>
            <p>BPMplus Showcase is a special section of the Forum dedicated to projects using emerging technologies such
                as artificial intelligence, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (XR). I am a
                Black maker who recognizes the value that emerging technologies can bring to traditional forms like
                film, but I feel out of my depth when exploring new technologies. Rarely do I find tech-centered spaces
                where I feel represented as a Black woman, but virtual BPMplus granted me access to such a space and
                liberated me from my own preoccupations about belonging.</p>
            <p>Moderated by Lisa Osborne, BPM’s Director of Emerging Media, BPMplus Showcase was hosted on Hopin, a
                virtual event platform. Six creators participated in <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/8358286">the
                    showcase</a>: Carla LynDale Bishop, LaJuné McMillian, Fabiano Mixo, Bayaté Ross Smith, Tamara
                Shogaolu, and Leonardo Souza. The artists pitched their projects to a virtual audience that included
                filmmakers, emerging technology entrepreneurs, distributors, press, and potential funders.</p>
            <p>Creators were allotted approximately 20 minutes to pitch their individual projects, and each pitch
                commenced with a 3–5-minute video, which provided attendees with a sneak peek behind the scenes. Through
                the videos, creators demonstrated their chosen technologies, highlighted the communities in which they
                work, expounded on their missions, and showcased user interfaces and experiences. Because the showcase
                aims to connect makers with funders and supporters, participants also shared budgets and project needs,
                hashtags, and contact information. Osborne conducted brief interviews with creators after each
                screening. Attendees shared reactions and questions for directors in the chat, and Osborne weaved
                audience questions into her interviews. Viewers inquired about everything from project hosting
                locations, roles of project participants, and curriculum pieces for educational institutions to project
                packaging and storing practices. In addition to questions, audience members affirmed their enthusiasm
                for their favorite projects by dropping encouraging notes and leads for potential support into the chat
                box.</p>
            <p>Across the presentations, three projects particularly resonated with my ruminations on Black access and
                representation in digital spaces.</p>

            <p>Currently in pre-production, “<strong><a
                        href="https://blackpublicmedia.org/360projects/mapping-blackness/">Mapping
                        Blackness</a></strong>” is a digital archive of historically Black communities by filmmaker and
                educator <strong>Carla LynDale Bishop</strong>. Last year, Bishop was named the inaugural recipient of
                the <a href="https://blackpublicmedia.org/360projects/mapping-blackness/">MIT Open Doc Lab and Black
                    Public Media Fellowship</a>. Through her work, Bishop uses an intergenerational approach to teach
                Black youth to document their communities’ vital histories. Young people learn documentary filmmaking
                and research skills in order to interview elders in their neighborhoods. From these interviews, students
                create film and interactive media elements to embed into digital maps, which viewers can access through
                a website or mobile app. The archive utilizes a combination of augmented reality, 3-D images, 360
                virtual reality, geo-tagging, and filmmaking to preserve and highlight communities that might otherwise
                go overlooked.</p>
            <p>The most striking elements of the archive are its 3-D and VR renderings of landmarks and spaces that no
                longer exist. Through these renderings, audiences can explore spaces that are central to collective
                memory. Bishop seeks to connect Black communities across America by making this archive widely
                accessible. Her goal is to create a curriculum that will teach families and communities how to record
                and submit their own stories to the platform, thus scaling the project.</p>

            <p><strong>LaJuné McMillian</strong>’s<strong> “Movement Portraits”</strong> explores Black joy and creation
                through motion-capture recordings of Black people as they dance and engage in physical improvisations.
                Through this work, McMillian aims to build a collection of diverse characters and movements that fill
                the void created by systems and repositories that consistently erase Black culture and influence.
                McMillian sees the Black Movement Library as a solution to the aforementioned challenges. The Library
                will be an online database of character-based models and motion capture data that includes information
                on performers and the histories of their movements. Performances are documented through motion capture
                and Unreal Engine, and performers are interviewed.</p>
            <p>“Interviews are embedded into the soundscapes that performers move to, allowing the audience to dive into
                their lives and learn more about how Black movement has been used as a tool for the preservation of
                Black culture as well as a vehicle of self-evolution,” McMillian said.</p>
            <p>Though movement portraits are real-time motion capture performances, McMillian intends to create
                single-channel video and virtual reality experiences as well. At present, two of the five portraits are
                completed. McMillian’s work centers Black identities by ensuring that Black performers are properly
                credited and foregrounded as they create intellectual property for the digital sphere.</p>

                <strong>Leonardo Souza</strong>’s<strong> “Rabiola Tales”</strong> is an animated 3-D virtual reality
                project that uses a fictional kite shop in a Rio de Janeiro favela as a point of departure for the
                exploration of the community. Souza created the project to counter the negative portrayals of favela
                life in popular media. Users will visit the kite shop and meet the storeowner, Paolo, who will teach
                them to fly kites. Users are then transported to a rooftop to fly their kites through VR controllers.
                The sky is full of other kites, which are controlled by artificial intelligence, and users will be able
                to interact with those kites.
            </p>
            <p>“I have always been fascinated by flying kites, “ Souza says. “It could be that feeling that I was
                flying, or maybe because the sky full of kites is just like a server hosting a multi-player game. It was
                my internet before I knew the internet.”</p>
            <p>Souza intends to share his project with middle and high schoolers in Brazil to facilitate access to VR.
                The 360VR version and VR workshopping of “Rabiola Tales” are complete and available in Portuguese with
                option for translations, and a more interactive version for the Oculus Quest 2 is in pre-production.</p>
            <p>As Lisa Osborne noted, “It is vitally important that Black creators have the means and support to try new
                software, hardware, and concepts in computing when these technologies are still in their experimental
                phase. Black talent needs access when the technology is still messy, when it is not stable.”</p>
            <p>Indeed, early access provides fertile ground for true learning and experimentation. These compelling
                projects will shift the prevailing narratives for their respective communities, participants, and
                makers, while, at the same time, diversifying emerging technology spaces in invaluable ways.</p>
