                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="17508153097794091698"><span class="marginnote">Developers,
                    UI/UX advisors, video &amp; graphic artists, project leads from team <em>Aashiyaan. See footer for
                        details.</em></span></figure>
            <p>When I travelled from India to be a Fellow at MIT’s Open Documentary Lab, I came carrying precious cargo
                — over 1 TB of footage culled from many phones. Some of it was grainy, some breathtakingly intense and
                some mundane. This formed the core of my interactive documentary <em>Aashiyaan, </em>which reveals New
                Delhi through the eyes of women whose stories are often excluded from mainstream narratives.</p>
            <p>When I started my journey I was already held afloat by the voluntary work done by former students,
                assistant directors, editors, friends and even the children of my co-creators. Little did I know that my
                rite of passage into the world of i-docs in USA would involve more volunteers in the form of hackers.
            </p>
            <p>Liani Lye and a few others are missing from the June 26 photograph above. Liani is the reason that I
                first found my way to the weekly pizza and hacking sessions organized by Code for Boston (CfB) in
                Cambridge, Massachusetts. A recent robotics major, she was focusing on “‘civic tech” and believed that
                her cohort at CfB would support my search for collaborators on the<a
                    href="https://immerse.news/co-creating-with-the-invisible-women-of-delhi-a718c0d25c03"> interactive
                    documentary</a> I was working on. As a Fellow at the Open Documentary Lab at MIT I had access to
                some of the brightest minds behind award winning and innovative XR projects, what I needed was a team
                that would support the work done by my <a
                    href="https://youtu.be/IZ-k60jik5k?list=PLTXq6Eg-6vhrY3Ydr0dNTWnTINXjoC79y">co-creators</a> from
                India — domestic workers and homemakers.</p>
            <p>No, the beta version of the interactive app<a href="http://www.aashiyaan.org/"> Aashiyaan</a><em>,
                </em>which is a result of weeks and months of voluntary labour<em>,</em> is not a donation from digital
                Robin Hoods. It is instead a product of an inspiring <em>gift economy</em>. As <a
                    href="https://www.codeforboston.org">a meetup for</a> “developers, designers, data geeks, citizen
                activists, and many others who use creative technology to solve civic and social problems” the CfB forum
                encourages a language of inclusion that is not only symbolic but also a social and relational
                embodiment. However, forming a team of regulars from a pool of volunteers is not easy. As Lewis Hyde
                points out in his book <em><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002GKGB00/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The
                        Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World</a></em>, “A gift economy allows its own
                form of individualism…Individualism in a gift economy inheres in the right to decide when and how to
                give the gift. The individual controls the flow of property away from [her/]him (rather than toward
                [her/]him, a different individualism).”</p>
            <p>Many came and many went, but the hackers who stayed on to volunteer — coding, graphic design, video
                editing, photography, user interaction, project management and much needed cheerleading skills — stood
                by the social contract of the space. Knowledge, art and creative solutions are achieved only by gifting
                ideas, hours, experiences and stories. This is perhaps why differences in language, socio-economics,
                race and even gender did not deter these individuals from coming on board. The ethos that a “group mind”
                is critical to such a project helped steer the interactions of the group. We were in agreement. As Hyde
                writes, “Each individual thinker can be awash in the ideas of [her/]his comrades…so that one is capable
                of cognitive tasks beyond the powers of any single person.”</p>
            <p>In practice this meant asking all the tough, honest and necessary questions that a filmmaker who wants to
                “use-code-to-tell-a-story” must be asked! Consequently, my wrists were also slapped when I helped myself
                to words that seemed commonsensical to me — scripts, design, user-stories, accessibility, etc.</p>
            <p>Instead, I learned that scripts are a sequence of commands or instructions that would enable experiential
                and thematic associations between the video fragments I wanted to showcase. Design is a reusable
                pattern, which works as a solution and saves the developer hours of coding. Albeit defined from the
                perspective of an end user, user-stories are pithy descriptions of software features that enable
                developers to extrapolate the time and effort required to produce them. Accessibility is a UI/UX gold
                mine: a map of elements, their hierarchies and relationships. It determines how users will navigate,
                perceive and comprehend your work.</p>
            <p>And there were the “users”! Swapping “audiences” and “stakeholders” with “users” was one of the most
                challenging processes for me. To think of a single user while designing navigational choices, graphic
                elements, language settings and screen sizes made me go back to the drawing board with the team
                repeatedly. Why were we creating a mobile app? How would we balance low bandwidth with the demands of
                the content?</p>
            <p>Since this was an artistic endeavor and not a commercial product with immediately measurable impact and
                linear thought, a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/waterfall-model">waterfall
                    model</a> of design couldn’t work. The process demanded that I lock down who I eventually hoped
                would interact with the app. This certainly wasn’t easy, since my co-creators belong to starkly diverse
                classes, castes, religions, regions and age groups. They also own different kinds of phones!</p>
            <p>Defining the user was also crucial to developing the Minimum Viable Product, i.e. MVP. MVP can be
                described as an artifact that would be able to engage early adopters with minimum number of features. It
                enables a more agile testing of user choices and helps direct feedback for future iterations. As
                practical as it may sound, as entrepreneur Eric Ries observes on his blog <a
                    href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html">Startup
                    Lessons Learned</a>, “MVP is quite annoying, because it imposes extra overhead. We have to manage to
                learn something from our first product iteration. In a lot of cases, this requires a lot of energy
                invested in talking to customers or metrics and analytics. Second…it is decidedly not formulaic. It
                requires judgment to figure out, for any given context, what MVP makes sense.” In the context of
                <em>Aashiyaan,</em> creating the MVP also meant sifting through the terrabyte of footage and choosing a
                precious few kilobytes.
            </p>
            <p>Had it not been for the sage reminders of the hackers at CfB, I would’ve taken longer, and found it
                impossible to edit down to fragments and curate the version of the app (currently being readied for the
                play store). A <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/arent-any-typos-essay-we-launched-too-late-reid-hoffman">quote</a>
                with almost biblical significance that I was nudged towards was “Fail Fast. If you’re not embarrassed by
                the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.” I’ve since repeated it with great impact
                to an art director, an engineer and a doctoral student.</p>
            <p>The journey from rough cuts to prototypes and from prototypes to MVPs has been one of great learning for
                me. The journey from gifts to wealth is most certainly in the human resources that have helped realize
                <em>Aashiyaan</em>.
            </p>
            <p>As we worked on the bilingual content of the app, a friend from CfB asked me how I would translate his
                identity — i.e. being a hacker — for native speakers in India. It didn’t take me too long to arrive at
                the word <em>jugaadu</em>, i.e. she/he who does <em>jugaad</em>. As improvisation to achieve a desired
                result, <em>jugaad</em> could be regarded as the Indian euphemism for an MVP.</p>
            <p>In my documentary <em>The Great Indian Jugaad</em> (2010) I explore numerous connotations of the term.
                The consensus that emerges from the film is that <em>jugaad </em>is the spirit of finding a solution
                despite all odds. In a 1993 ethnographic study of a team of developers titled <em>Artificial
                    Intelligence as Craftwork</em>, Lucy A. Suchman and Randall H. Trigg talk of “skilled
                improvisation”<em> </em>as ideating in a team such that material and cognitive possibilities can be
                realized despite constraints. For them, the whiteboard becomes a site for performing intellectual and
                emotional investment that in turn lead to “…concrete conceptual objects.” I have had the privilege of
                partaking in and witnessing such processes at CfB.</p>

                    testing <em>Aashiyaan </em>MVP 1 at CIC-Arts Technica 2018</span></figure>
            <p>We were invited to participate in XR media fairs where we managed to test MVP 1. Heartened by the
                results, we set our sights on MVP 2. Every week, our numbers swelled and we gradually took up most of
                the space in the CfB hack nights.</p>
            <p>As the project drew more hackers to the discussions and coding marathons, it became clear that
                <em>Aashiyaan</em> needed to become a transmedia experience eventually. This meant deep diving into
                those terabytes again. With each hour of engaging with the gift economy, the circulation of gifts we
                received increased. Several students, associates and friends from across the globe volunteered to
                translate the footage from Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Jharkhandi, Urdu and Haryanvi to English.
