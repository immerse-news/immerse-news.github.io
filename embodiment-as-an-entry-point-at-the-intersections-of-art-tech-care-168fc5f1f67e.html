            <p>Salima Punjani is a Montreal artist working in installations and facilitating participatory environments,
                connecting audiences with access through multiple senses and a diverse set of media. Her art centers
                welcoming and counters alienation. Initially working in journalism to highlight under-documented
                communities, her recent pieces are multi-sensory, including soft sculptural installations as sources of
                sound, vibration and scent, as well as works that incorporate biometric data like recorded heartbeats
                and brainwaves. One that has particularly foregrounded co-authoring with disabled people is
                <em>Progression</em>, created in 2018.
            </p>
            <p><em>Progression</em> features MRI brain scans of several people with multiple sclerosis (MS), including
                Salima. Each participant contributed an MRI image and a photo portrait they wanted Salima to layer
                together to offer a narrative around cognitive change that might challenge assumptions.</p>
            <p>Besides the photographic composites, she laser-engraved wood panels to reproduce fine detail from each
                subject’s brain scan, providing tactile, non-visual access to the pattern images. She also recorded and
                sonified each participant’s brainwaves while they were interviewed about their portraits. Then, she
                created small stuffed pillows containing vibrotactile transducers to send each subject’s distinct wave
                patterns through in tactile pulses, so exhibit attendees could feel them while touching the pillows, as
                a non-hearing mode of access. Wanting to familiarize attendees with these technologies in a
                non-intimidating way, Salima’s been present to offer introductions for trying on <a
                    href="https://choosemuse.com/">Muse headsets</a> available in the installations, to directly
                experience the EEG headsets’ brainwave-sensing transmission to a vibration pattern format.</p>
            <p>The most recent public activities she’s shared have been tactile/listening events with groups of youth or
                adults, facilitated online or in person outdoors. Attendees are introduced to vibrotactile pillows,
                which vibrate according to sound samples that each participant contributes. In the events, people then
                take turns experiencing and commenting on the sonic and haptic patterns they perceive.</p>
            <p>Since meeting Salima soon after I moved to Montreal in 2017, I’ve been struck by her care in fostering
                artful narratives that focus on connecting with both the subjects featured in her projects and the
                audience, providing multiple entry points to enable inclusion and agency for people with a range of
                embodiments. I’m excited to share this interview conversation, edited for clarity. Find more on her work

            <p><strong>seeley quest: Can you talk about your focus of inviting reflections on community experiences, and
                    on choosing to explore different technologies for entry modes?</strong></p>
            <p>Salima Punjani: Community experiences are important to me. I don’t feel there needs to be a dichotomy
                between community or socially engaged art and what’s considered professional art. Working in community
                with technology, like [hosting] sensory listening workshops, is quite meaningful for me … [such public
                activities are] some of my favorite things that I do. People are invited to bring a sound based on a
                theme: comfort or belonging or whatever feels relevant at the time, and we come together. So far I’ve
                held the workshops at a city park, and with [the artists’ centre] Ada X in person as well as online.</p>
            <p>It creates an opportunity to deeply listen to each other, not just through words but through felt
                sensation and a way to have an immersive experience even if maybe we don’t have so much capacity. It
                helps people have a certain quality of presence with each other, and people give really meaningful
                feedback and interpretations to each other. And it’s simple — it’s just a sound and a vibration and the
                energy of us together. Moving forward in my work I’m heading towards a bit more simplicity; when it
                comes to technologies I’m trying to simplify things because constantly figuring out new technology
                [isn’t that accessible for me].</p>
            <p><strong>sq: You’ve been working on projects involving translation: renderings of relationships to
                    neurological change by people with MS, transmission of sound to pulse patterns that can be felt by
                    Deaf audiences. How do you approach the concept of translation?</strong></p>
            <p>SP: When you’re feeling brain waves, you’re feeling the frequencies that I’ve chosen for you to feel,
                translat[ing] biodata in a way that isn’t to find something wrong, but instead builds connectedness
                between people.</p>
            <p><strong>sq: How are subjects responding to the presentation of their content? Are audiences responding in
                    any ways you wouldn’t anticipate?</strong></p>
            <p>SP: I’m shocked [subjects are] so chill about using their biodata. I made <em>Progression</em> in 2018
                and have exhibit[ed] it five times after that, even though people’s stories have changed. We joke about
                that; they actually are saying I should do an updated version with stories that are more recent. People
                are happy to share their stories and to dimensionalize the experiences of people with MS past the
                assumptions that exist.</p>
            <p>Another piece, <em>The Cost of Entry as a Heartbeat</em> (2020) uses heartbeat data and sounds recorded
                in Budapest thermal baths to create a collective rest environment. For most people it’s very relaxing,
                yet for others the opposite; I’ve had some big reactions to the piece. Both of the times [it’s been
                installed], there’ve been people that had panic attacks or strong stress responses, because the
                heartbeat [sound] was too fast, or they hadn’t really had experience with such an immersive environment.
            </p>
            <p>I’m grateful I have training in care work so I know what to do when that happens. It’s the reason I
                studied social work, to slow down and really think about how to make sure there are structures of care
                in my projects. There are often ways people react that aren’t what I anticipated in creating a project,
                and at the same time I feel relatively confident that I have skills to support if something comes up. [I
                take] the evocative potential of art seriously, not lightly at all.</p>

            <p><strong>q: Do you have goals regarding immersive encounters?</strong></p>
            <p>SP: Yes. I’ve had the opportunity to experience spatial sound in magnificent contexts: at Monom in
                Berlin, the Spatial Sound Institute in Budapest, and Lobe studio in Vancouver. My interests lie in
                bringing experiences to communities: disabled folks, BIPOC folks, people at intersections that might not
                have access to go into these sound studios, as there are only three in the world that use 4D sound
                technology. I’m currently, through support of the Canada Council of the Arts, working on developing a
                mobile spatial sound studio to bring into schools or different communities, to democratize the
                technology a bit. It’s in a space where people have to go to it now, but I’d like to bring it to people.
                It’s valuable to offer these immersive experiences of rest to communities underserved. So that’s big for
                me, to democratize vibrational multi-sensory environments.</p>
            <p>This summer a collaborator, Greer Pester, and I worked on developing large vibrotactile soft sculptures
                based on body parts and we finished the project with making a ’zine: a version of an experience which
                can be mailed to people that has prompts and different materials that explore the senses. I’ve
                experienced powerful work, such as <a href="https://rachaelyoung.org/projects/thirst-trap/">Ray Young’s
                </a><em>THIRST TRAP </em><a href="https://rachaelyoung.org/projects/thirst-trap/">(2022)</a> through
                London’s Unlimited Festival that I had the opportunity to go to this year. <em>THIRST TRAP </em>was an
                at-home experience where you listened to an audio file, and received this box that had different
                materials. It was meant to be experienced in the bathtub and was about climate change …put together in a
                way that felt like a ritual — immersive through smell, light, water temperature and the depth of the
                water being so specific — and a bath bomb. Incredibly well done, it had great entry and exit rituals,
                made you feel part of something collectively [and was available for] a good length of time so you could
                access it whenever you had the capacity to spend that time to experience it.</p>
            <p>I’m excited to see how these kinds of care or exhibition packages can support people in experiencing
                immersive work. I’m working on developing a project related to grief and collective care that will find
                a way to do this. [I’m] moving towards some simplicity, also play and pleasure in my work.</p>
            <p><strong>sq: Would you expand on your next directions?</strong></p>
            <p>SP: I’m working on this mobile spatial sound studio, with a grant from the Arts Council for two more
                years to dig into my research areas. I’m [building] a performance piece/ritual that invites letting go
                of something, holding something for someone else, and having some sort of collective release related to
                grief and loss to create a space where holding something for someone else feels possible without it
                feeling overwhelming. My activism is based on mutual care and mutual aid in a loving way, dealing with
                things collectively present and hard to hold, and finding ways to bring that into an artistic space that
                can give a tiny bit of relief.</p>
            <p>I’ll host a gathering space for disabled artists at Trinity Square Video in Toronto, July 2023. <a
                    href="https://prismmagazine.ca/2021/01/14/complicities-a-review-of-aimee-louws-less-sweet-than-chocolate-or-concrete">Aimee
                    Louw’s poem</a> about being held in an unspectacular space was really inspiring to me. I’d like to
                host an informal gathering for artists to come together and just <em>be with</em> each other, without
                some event or conference.</p>
            <p>In 2024 I’m heading towards curation at <a href="https://tangledarts.org/">Tangled Gallery</a>. I’ve been
                invited to create a show so I’m researching artists, just meeting people, visiting studios, talking to
                curators I admire, bringing learnings I’ve had from the disability arts community over the last few
                years to my curatorial practice.</p>
