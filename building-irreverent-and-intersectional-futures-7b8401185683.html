            <p>“The future of breastfeeding is irreverent and intersectional, with mamas, parents, and babies at the
                center.” This forward-looking values statement from the “<a
                    href="https://makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/our-values">Make the Breast Pump Not Suck</a>” project
                team can be found in <em><a

                        Truths</a></em>, a book filled with firsthand accounts of what it’s like to breastfeed in the US
                today. While the project team is working to make that vision of the future a reality, there are many
                hurdles to overcome.</p>
            <p>Perhaps nothing encapsulates the present-day struggles better than the design of the typical breast pump
                itself.</p>

            <p>Noisy, clunky, and with many hard-to-clean parts, the breast pump is a piece of technology that has long
                been in need of innovation. In the “Make the Breast Pump Not Suck” team’s <a
                    href="http://www.kanarinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BreastpumpPaper_CHI_pn2106.pdf">research</a>,
                breast pump users identified mobility, discretion, easy cleaning, and comfort as key areas for
                improvement.</p>
            <p>Systemic issues such as cultural taboos and <a
                    href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-employers-make-it-impossible-for-working-women-to-breastfeed_n_5d7a45b2e4b0a938a42ef3f5">hostile
                    work environments</a> only exacerbate the problems that those using breast pumps face. Further,
                policy issues surrounding the broader context of breastfeeding, such as a lack of federal <a
                    href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/paid-family-leave-in-the-states.aspx">paid
                    parental leave policies</a>, point to the ways that the breast pump’s issues are connected to
                broader issues in maternal and reproductive health. It’s within this context that this project began.
            </p>
            <p><a href="http://www.alexishope.com/">Alexis Hope</a>, a current graduate student in the MIT Media Lab,
                and <a href="http://www.kanarinka.com/">Catherine D’Ignazio</a>, currently an Assistant Professor in
                MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning, started the project in 2014. They expanded their team in
                2018 to include Binta Beard (Policy Summit Lead), Kate Krontiris (Research Lead), Rebecca Michelson
                (Project Manager), and Jennifer Roberts (Equity and Inclusion Lead). Hope explained that the impetus for
                the event came from D’Ignazio’s own experience navigating structural barriers to breastfeeding while
                working at MIT. The creators of the “Make the Breast Pump Not Suck” hackathon do not describe their
                approach in terms of a specific design framework. However, frameworks such as participatory design and
                design justice provide useful lenses to use in drawing lessons from the project’s successes.</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-1">Collective Wisdom</a>, we provide
                a survey of participatory frameworks used across a wide array of fields, including participatory design,
                which is <a
                    href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/participatory-design/phil_pd.html">characterized
                    by a deeply collaborative process</a> between trained designers and the intended users of a
                particular system. Although it has <a
                    href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts//courses/cs181/projects/participatory-design/pol_push.html">political
                    roots</a>, present-day conceptions of the practice vary widely. As such, the term “participatory
                design” can be found as an approach in <a href="http://v">corporate design processes</a>, as well as an
                <a href="http://www.publicsphereproject.org/node/235">underlying philosophical approach</a> to design
                work overall. This has fueled the development of design frameworks that more explicitly address issues
                of inequity through participatory methods. <a
                    href="http://designjusticenetwork.org/network-principles">Design justice</a> is one such framework,
                with a set of guiding principles that prioritize design’s impact on communities over the intentions of
                designers.

            <p>Hope says that work by the Design Justice Network informed their project’s shifting approach. This is
                perhaps most evident in the <a href="https://makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/our-values">hackathon’s
                    statement of values</a>, which forefronts inclusivity, intersectionality, and equity. The commitment
                to these values has led to a more comprehensive form of partnership over time. Hope says of the group’s
                approach to creating an event through participatory approaches, “I fundamentally believe in the
                relationship-based approach… slowing down your process quite a lot.” This attitude is reflected in the
                evolution of the project from more typical participatory design methods in 2014 to the longer, more
                deeply collaborative approach taken in 2018.</p>
            <p>The original Make the Breast Pump Not Suck Hackathon in 2014 gave general audiences a chance to submit
                ideas, stories, and prompts that formed an idea wall that hackathon teams referred to for inspiration.
                It also included scholarships to amplify under-represented voices in hackathon teams. This event’s
                noteworthy outcomes include <a href="http://uboostsupply.com/2017oct-investor-update/">product
                    launches</a> and media attention for breast-feeding issues. However, the 2014 hackathon’s audience,
                <a
                    href="http://peerproduction.net/issues/issue-8-feminism-and-unhacking/peer-reviewed-papers/towards-a-feminist-hackathon-the-make-the-breast-pump-not-suck/">according
                    to the team</a>, was a largely privileged group. It did not include as diverse a range of
                participants as the team had hoped. Further, most project teams focused on the technical and mechanical
                aspects of existing breast pumps, despite the encouragement throughout the event to think beyond
                technical solutions.

            <p>The hackathon’s second iteration in 2018 presented a significantly more intersectional focus and more
                deeply collaborative process of event planning. The build-up to the event included a <a
                    href="https://makethebreastpumpnotsuck2018.com/community">community innovation program</a> that
                supported groups already working on issues of reproductive justice across the country. These groups
                provided monthly input on the event planning and worked on projects during the hackathon event.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/533/0*VH_ZgluCP90XtdA_" width="800"><label

                    hackathon.</span></figure>
            <p>This deeply collaborative approach had some key benefits for the hackathon planning team overall. It
                expanded their conception of community needs and opportunities, as well as problem spaces for hackathon
                projects. Hope explained that this collaborative event also resulted in designs that would not have come
                out of the 2014 hackathon. For example, Rachel Lorenzo, founder of <a
                    href="https://www.iwrising.org/">Indigenous Women Rising</a>, worked with her team on <a
                    href="https://www.iwrising.org/breastfeeding-advocacy">breastfeeding-friendly prototypes of
                    traditional clothing</a>.</p>
            <p>When asked about practical advice she might give people planning similar events of their own, Hope notes
                that everything takes longer than designers intend. There is a need to budget time and resources that
                are not usually accounted for in the planning process, as relationship building cannot be rushed. She
                also suggests that White folks working in spaces of equity invest time and resources to unpack the
                damaging effect that structural racism can have on a participatory project like this.</p>
            <p>Currently, D’Ignazio and Hope are taking the lessons they learned from these events and are applying them
                to the topic of menstruation in a hackathon event slated for 2020 titled, “<a
                    href="https://www.media.mit.edu/events/there-will-be-blood/">There Will Be Blood</a>.” Of all the
                lessons learned throughout the “Make the Breast Pump Not Suck” events, Hope highlights one in
                particular. “My main takeaway is this type of work is never really finished,” she says of the
                partnership-building aspects of the project. There are always more ways to improve and learn in a
                collaborative process, and there are always more ways to advance justice in professional/academic
                fields.</p>
