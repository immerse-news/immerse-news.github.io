                <li>Create projects that don’t originate from the single-author vision. Rather, ideas originate from
                    relationships.</li>
                <li>Create projects that emerge from the process, potentially with many outcomes rather than solely
                    outcome-driven processes.</li>
                <li>Make media with people and from within communities, rather than for, or about, them.</li>
                <li>Reframe who gets to tell which story, who owns it and why, Grounded in principles of racial equity,
                    narrative sovereignty and digital justice.</li>
                <li>Work with citizens, communities, and scholars across institutions, across disciplines, in a shared,
                    parallel discovery process. These processes are often entangled with non-human systems.</li>
                <li>Ensure all partners respect each other’s expertise, including first-hand experience. Challenge power
                    dynamics, and prioritize inclusion, equity and diversity.</li>
                <li>Use appropriate technology, workflows, tools, protocols, leadership, teams and roles, and multiple
                    modes of storytelling.</li>
                <li>Ensure that impact, sustainability, healing and reciprocity are paramount. How will communities
                    benefit from the project?</li>
                <li>Not only interpret the world, but change it. Tackle complex problems by acknowledging a multiplicity
                    of points-of-view, and ensure that solutions come from within communities.</li>
                <li>Share and learn. Be open. Contribute to transparent, open and public knowledge frameworks.</li>
