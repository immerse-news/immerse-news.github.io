            <p>By Jessica Clark</p>
            <p>In <a href="https://immerse.news/booting-up-immersive-news-labs-b35382954c1b#.cjqlt872x">this issue</a>,
                we take a look at how news labs at major outlets are experimenting with immersive and interactive
                storyforms. These new forays take place in the context of a sustained and increasingly shrill crisis in
                the industry—topped off by the most recent soul-searching over the alt-facts formerly known as “fake
                news.”</p>
            <p>Can innovation actually save journalism? Will immersive platforms succeed in engaging and truth-telling
                where print and broadcast have failed? Here are some resources to help us all puzzle it through.</p>

            <p>The March issue of <em>Wired </em>puts the news crisis front-and-center with a deep look at <a
                    href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/new-york-times-digital-journalism/">innovation efforts at the
                </a><em><a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/new-york-times-digital-journalism/">New York
                        Times</a></em>. Immersive journalism is only one in an array of efforts to attract and capture
                users’ digital news dollars—including bots, megapuzzles, podcasts, gadget reviews, and other efforts
                previously dubbed not “Timesian” enough. Reporter Gabriel Snyder—who late in the article reveals that he
                was <em>The New Republic’s</em> editor when Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes decided to unload it—also
                casts a critical eye on the role of deep-pocketed publishers as innovation patrons.</p>

            <p>The innovation marketplace is a fickle creature. One minute VR is the Next Big Thing; the next minute, <a

                moment, media futurists have their eyes on new tools and practices designed to combat the flood of false
                news and propaganda.</p>

                with support from Google News Lab—lays out the various types of “problematic content.”</p>

            <p>The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism released its <a

                    predictions</a> with a lukewarm assessment of immersive tech’s role in news.</p>
            <p>“With the initial excitement of 2016’s launches fading away, the key questions now relate to how the
                platforms will evolve and what we’ll be able to do with them. Ultimately consumers who are not
                interested in gaming will need a compelling reason to invest their time and attention whether that be
                360 degree video tours, news or sport experiences, or the kind of immersive social worlds that Facebook
                are planning to build. Some argue that this year will see the beginning of VR’s transition from a
                curiosity into something more tangible. Others say that fully immersive use cases will always be too
                limiting and the future lies in a world where digital experiences augment rather than replace our
                reality.”</p>

            <p>In contrast, the report—based on survey feedback from 143 digital leaders from 24 countries—predicts
                widespread innovation in “conversational journalism,” facilitated by messaging apps, chat bots, and the
                rise of voice-driven personal assistants such as Siri and Alexa.</p>
