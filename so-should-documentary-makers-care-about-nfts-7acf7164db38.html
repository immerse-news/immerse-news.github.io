                organization</h3>
            <p>Perspective is a rare commodity in the midst of a gold rush.</p>
            <p>In this issue of <em>Immerse, </em>we’re considering the intersection of new forms of assets and avatars,
                and how they complicate already fraught questions of access to emerging digital worlds. At the center of
                these questions sit NFTs (non-fungible tokens) — unique blocks of code stored via Ethereum or other
                cryptocurrencies. (If you still don’t know what that means, you’re <a
                    href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq">not
                    alone</a>.)</p>
            <p>Minters of NFTs have already made a huge splash in the world of digital art collection — although more
                traditional artists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/arts/design/nft-art-beeple.html">have
                    questions</a>. NFTs have also been used to assign value to key moments in digital history: Take
                Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet, which sold for an astronomical $2.9 million in 2020, but <a
                    href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2022/04/14/why-jack-dorseys-first-tweet-nft-plummeted-99-in-value-in-a-year/?sh=4093d89165cb">had
                    lost 99% of its value</a> by April. In fact, over the past year, the buzz about NFTs has soured,
                moving from <a href="https://www.oneartnation.com/nft-101-for-those-with-nft-fomo/">FOMO</a> to <a
                    href="https://medium.com/the-clubhouse/turn-nft-fomo-into-jomo-4258b5764abf">JOMO</a> (the joy of
                missing out). Both cryptocurrency and NFTs have become juicy targets for <a

                    and hackers</a>, and amidst this latest <a

            </p>
            <p>Given all of the frenzy, how should makers of nonfiction media be thinking about what this means for
                their work in the long term? How might documentary photographers, for example, sell their images <a
                    href="https://www.jonnymelon.com/nft-photography-guide/#:~:text=Non%2Dfungible%20tokens%20can%20be,copies%20of%20the%20original%20file.">on
                    the blockchain</a>? Is it possible to assign unique value to <a
                    href="https://pixelplex.io/blog/how-fractional-ntfs-work/">fractions of a film</a>? Will this be
                just one more media innovation eye-rollingly <a
                    href="https://www.jumpstartmag.com/gender-in-the-nft-economy/">dominated by tech dudes</a>?</p>
            <p>To get a better vantage point on these questions, I spoke with Yao Huang. A seasoned entrepreneur and
                investor, she’s seen boom-and-bust cycles come and go. She’s also an advocate of women in tech — I met
                her at one of the <a href="https://wonderwomen.hatchery.vc/">Wonder Woman</a> dinners she’s been hosting
                for more than 15 years across the country. Here are outtakes from our discussion, edited for length and
                clarity.</p>

            <h3 id="6302"><strong>Jessica Clark: Could you please tell us a bit about your work?</strong></h3>
            <p>Yao Huang: I’m the founder of <a href="http://yaohuihuang.com/">the Hatchery.</a> We’ve been around for
                16 years, involved in each level of the Internet as it’s come about and have helped build out the New
                York tech scene. We invest in tech companies, partner with corporations and startups, build these teams
                and create innovative solutions, and drive new revenue streams into existing structures.</p>
            <p>Right now I’m an advisor on technology that protects this new layer of blockchain crypto NFTs.
                Essentially, it’s new infrastructure for commerce and transactions that need security. The largest area
                of fraud and hacking is within crypto wallets right now.</p>
            <p>We’re also involved in a hundred million dollar fund trying to open up access to capital for minorities
                and women in a way that I think is more fitting. I believe that venture is made for 2% of companies,
                maybe even less. It’s really not meant for everyone, it’s meant for scale — I call it the steroids of
                companies. Once you take that money, you’re expected to grow at a specific pace that often is unnatural
                for the possibility of a future by grabbing market share by scaling fast. And that’s fine, but that’s
                not right for all.</p>
            <h3 id="f317"><strong>JC: When did you start seeing NFTs coming into the conversation and what really piqued
                    your interest about them?</strong></h3>
            <p>YH: Well, it’s been around for a number of years, and I work with some of the folks who were there in the
                early days. It’s only gotten into the mainstream in the last year. I first got into it through the music
                and art industries and how they’re using it through rights management, by creating a digital asset. I’m
                seeing more opportunities in the commercial space now in the supply chain in being able to track where
                products were made. I mean, there are so many uses to dive into, if you’re curious.</p>
            <h3 id="1d33"><strong>JC: I got interested in talking to you about this when we were at the Paradigm Gallery
                    in Philly, and I heard you talking to the owner about the ability to fractionalize investment and
                    put a value on different bits and pieces of audio. How might we be able to use these technologies in
                    documentary?</strong></h3>
            <p>YH: Yeah, it’s big in the art world — and pretty established now. And the organizations I work with are
                white-label platforms for Christie’s and Sotheby’s. It’s just a lot of technology to process this, to
                maintain provenance. Like, <em>this</em> is the certificate and proof that these are real, which works
                really well for the big artists.</p>
            <p>What’s coming about now is for those with creative pieces where it might be more interactive, opening up
                a whole new realm of art for those who are immersed in these mediums. For those who are still using
                paintbrushes, it’s a little harder.</p>
            <h3 id="b488"><strong>JC: When you say interactive, do you mean in the relationship between the customer and
                    the artist?</strong></h3>
            <p>YH: Yeah. Here’s something the paintbrush man won’t understand.</p>
            <p>So [let’s say] I create 3D art that moves to a DJ’s music. And I partner with a big DJ at a big festival.
                The whole world sees it and now they want to buy my art.</p>
            <p>Huh? You didn’t go to an art gallery. You don’t have an agent. You were pimped out by a DJ. That’s
                different because the visual moved with the DJ or you made something that worked really well if you’re
                on LSD. The art looked amazing; it was designed for drugs, right? So it’s a reflection of how creative
                you can be with your art in new ways, for today’s time.</p>
            <h3 id="2a5f"><strong>JC: It’s also about making things that are able to be copied many times collectible in
                    a new way. So when we think about reality versus creative art, there are moments that people might
                    want to collect or own in a way that they couldn’t before. There’s potential not just fictional or,
                    or made up things to become valuable, but things that exist in the world in the way documentarians
                    have been capturing them.</strong></h3>
            <p>YH: Well, movies and some sports shows are cutting up pieces to disperse. I don’t know about
                documentaries. Maybe a similar concept.</p>
            <p>But I mean, you could do anything with NFTs. The issue is, are you doing it for commerce? Like, are you
                trying to make money from it? Because then you’ll need something that has some weight and value that
                people want. So, you know, usually it’s tied to big titles, big studios, big artists, something, you
                know, notable. That’s usually how it plays.</p>
            <h3 id="dd59"><strong>JC: The people that I tend to work with are makers. So they want to know, can I sell
                    my art? Can I sell my product?</strong></h3>
            <p>YH: <em>Can they connect with investors?</em> They can, it’s called marketing. It’s not just, “I make it
                and they will come.” You have to market. You have to have a network. You gotta push it through. You need
                people to persuade. You can pay someone to do it. You don’t have the money? Then maybe you want a
                partnership with a percentage. All of this takes work. It’s part of marketing for anything, from diapers
                or paintings.</p>
            <h3 id="9659"><strong>JC: So I’m not going to tell my reader NFTs will solve all their problems.</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>YH: Stay at your job, do your work, make your money, get a mortgage, all the good things, you know?</p>
            <h3 id="216e"><strong>JC: Could you talk a little bit about the Wonder Woman dinners you’ve been hosting and
                    how you think women can get more into this tech space?</strong></h3>
            <p>YH: The dinners started 16 years ago. It’s a collection of just amazing people, innovators, investors,
                just people doing interesting things, but with a “no asshole” role. Good vibes, good people, and helpful
                community supportiveness. There’s a lot of crypto/blockchain folks in our circles. And it’s there for
                groups of women who, when we started probably had less access to leveling up opportunities. And now
                probably more, but could still use it.</p>
            <p>In the world of crypto right now, it feels like the early days of the internet. It’s very bro heavy,
                probably because a lot of the early folks were engineers and entrepreneurs, because it came out of tech
                and then went into banking.</p>
            <p>It’s high testosterone. It’s like you go to these conferences and parties with women hired to be models
                there. It’s a little nuts.</p>
            <p>There’s a lot of women in tech. They can get involved….it could just be that they’re not that interested
                in it because it looks risky. Women tend to be more risk-averse, more stable. But there are different
                places to play. They don’t have to play where the boys are playing. They can build the tech that runs
                this.</p>
            <p>I keep going back to infrastructure; I think they should go play there. Control it all, right? You can be
                the bank, you know?</p>
            <p>Things are changing all the time. There’ll be a new set of technology — this just happens. happens to be
                the one. The one before this was AI, machine learning. So just learn, find a spot you find interesting,
                and play.</p>
