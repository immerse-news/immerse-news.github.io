            <p><em>by Mandy Rose &amp; David Green</em></p>
            <p>Between 2017 and 2020, our interdisciplinary research team explored the potential of virtual reality for
                documentary within the <a href="http://vrdocumentaryencounters.co.uk/">Virtual Realities: Immersive
                    Documentary Encounters</a> project. Drawing on the traditions of Computer Science, Documentary
                Studies and Experimental Psychology research, we conducted a series of quantitative and qualitative
                studies; we created <a href="http://vrdocumentaryencounters.co.uk/vrmediography/">an online
                    mediography</a> which offers a snapshot of the themes, teams and extent of English language VR work
                between 2012 and 2018; and we commissioned three path-finding VR projects.</p>
            <p>In seeking to understand the potential of VR for documentary, <strong>audience research</strong> was
                central to our project. Our experimental lab-based studies explored <a

            <p>We also conducted a major study to explore how audiences experience VR nonfiction in sociocultural

            <h2 id="712a">Exploring audience responses to VR nonfiction in the home</h2>
            <p>To gain an understanding of how VR might fit into people’s wider media usage, we developed an audience
                study and engaged a diverse cohort of households from Bristol, UK, to participate in the study. To
                include the perspectives of participants who are poorly reflected in research into emerging media
                technology, we worked with two local community organisations; <a href="https://kwmc.org.uk/">Knowle West
                    Media Centre</a>, an arts centre based in a lower-middle income area of Bristol, and <a
                    href="https://www.refugeewomenofbristol.org.uk/">Refugee Women of Bristol</a>, a “multi-ethnic,
                multi-faith organisation which targets the needs of refugee women in Bristol.<em>”</em></p>
            <p>In partnership with the community organisations, we co-hosted six informal VR experience days where
                people could drop in and try VR — often for the first time. After following-up with people who showed an
                interest in the project, to talk through the approach and process, we settled on 12 households; 35
                participants; a mixed group socioeconomically, culturally, and in terms of gender and age.</p>

            <p>We gave each household an <em>Oculus Go </em>pre-loaded with 46 pieces of curated VR nonfiction content
                around eight of the most popular themes (as revealed by our mediography work) — Space, Human Migration,
                Art &amp; History, World Cultures, among them.</p>

            <p>To gain insights into what participants made of VR beyond their initial impression, and to explore
                whether they formed any habits in relation to the platform, we spread the study out over several months.

            <p>We talked to participants about their experiences in two in-depth, semi-structured group interviews — the
                first when we delivered the equipment, another at the end of the study — and we kept in touch with
                participants via WhatsApp throughout the study, asking questions and prompting them to engage with new
                content.</p>
            <h2 id="d4b0"><strong>Responses to VR nonfiction</strong></h2>
            <p>Participants from all households, across all demographics, saw positive potential in virtual encounters
                with real people and places in VR. They made clear connections between the affordances of VR for
                immersion and presence and their sense of engagement with nonfiction themes.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“It didn’t matter where I went, I felt like I was in it, you know? On Valens Reef I’d find myself
                    holding my breath, because it felt underwater.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“In the story of water in Pakistan, where the community were gathering outside of their house and
                    they were kind of coming up with different ideas of how to clean the water. You feel — in that
                    moment — you are sitting next to them.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Participants felt that that their understanding of factual subject matter was enhanced by the feeling of
                virtual proximity to people and places in VR, and by the perspective taking allowed by 360 degree media.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“I think you get a lot more from VR. Being able to understand the person’s story — like the blind guy
                    in [Notes on Blindness: Into Darkness]… It just gives you more of a sense of what he’s feeling. You
                    wouldn’t get that watching a documentary on a flat screen.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“VR helps you understand real world problems. You see it from their perspective. You can understand
                    them.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Research participants made frequent comparisons between VR and TV in which they drew out the value of
                immersion for conveying a vivid sense of real-world scenes.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“It’s better in VR because you can look up at the buildings, you can see the sky; you can turn
                    around. Whereas you wouldn’t get that watching TV.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“360° immersion in the rubble somewhere in Syria hits home a lot harder than it does watching on a
                    48” TV, because it’s all there, around you.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We were interested to note how the values that participants highlighted in these VR experiences resonated
                with currents within the documentary tradition — in particular the quality of experience prized within
                Observational Cinema and which Direct Cinema pioneer Richard Leacock called, the “feeling of being
                there”.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“In the story of water in Pakistan*, where the community were gathering outside of their house and
                    they were kind of coming up with different ideas of how to clean the water. You feel — in that
                    moment — you are sitting next to them.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Alongside these positives, participants also expressed a number of pertinent reservations about
                nonfiction VR. Some had concerns about the emotional and persuasive power of the medium. Others worried
                that presence had the potential to amplify the impact of distressing or intense content, with
                implications for vulnerable users.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“I have had to flee… I have had to run for my life. I don’t know if that would trigger a memory.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“I’d be careful about showing it to people on drugs, or if they’ve got mental illness, because I
                    think it could be very confusing”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Some participants mused about VR’s persuasiveness, and wondered about its potential for manipulation.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“Actually, I trusted the content in the VR more… because I was in it. So I think it could be really
                    persuasive, which is interesting.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“I suppose — in that it had the potential for a person to empathize more deeply with a subject —
                    that’s like the currency of propaganda.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Others noticed how, while presence endowed content with a compelling veracity, it also obscured the
                mediated nature of the content — the director’s choices and point-of-view.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“It’s not the same, because you feel immersed in it — you feel like you’ve been somewhere, and you
                    feel like you know about it; but actually, you just know one person — one filmmaker’s —
                    perspective.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>While they offered these valuable insights, participants also expressed reservations about VR as a medium
                at home, and demonstrated those through a lack of sustained engagement. Seven out of the twelve
                households stopped engaging after one or two weeks. For three others, it was a more gradual tapering.
                Only two households persevered until the end of the study, and they conceded that doing so was out of a
                sense of duty to the research project. The headset was the problem. Most felt VR to be unsociable when
                others were at home, and they felt vulnerable if they used it when they were home alone.</p>
            <p>More research will be needed to understand immersive media’s potential for nonfiction in a domestic
                setting. Perhaps augmented or mixed reality platforms might deliver some of what participants valued in
                VR, without the sense of dislocation from other people and the physical environment. However,
                participants’ wish for sociality led them to speculate on the potential of VR for social connection.
                Some wished that they could jointly experience the VR content that was made available within the study.
                Others mused on VR’s potential for co-presence with others who they were separated from. With Covid-19
                enforcing social distancing, and people turning to virtual reality as a platform for connection rather
                than isolation, their insights take on particular relevance and poignancy, and suggest that sociality
                ought to be a central concern within future VR nonfiction research and production.</p>
