            <p>The writing in <em>Immerse</em>’s “Publics” issue imaginatively and concretely address the potential
                discursive space of the public sphere — and the ways public art, digital art, AR and VR works fossilize
                and dislodge notions of interactivity, accessibility and permanence. Often, abstract ideas of audiences
                and the public are invoked to justify decisions in the content and the presentation of works. These
                pieces provide insights into the material and experiential realities of specific communities. They span
                a survey of social media archives of recent protest street projections in South America; highlights from
                a unique qualitative study on home users of VR headsets from the UK-based <em>Virtual Realities;
                    Immersive Documentary Encounters</em> research group; and interviews with the collaborative creators
                of sound art installations, digital exhibitions, podcasts and a tool for “proxy protest.”</p>
            <p>This themed issue is the first that I’ve shepherded from concept to publishing as the editor of
                <em>Immerse</em>. It’s been a joy to work with the longstanding editorial collective to dream up
                collaborations with writers, practitioners and scholars to spotlight the vital work that has been made
                and distributed outside the established film and exhibition festival systems. I worked for several years
                as a film festival programmer before joining the MIT Open Documentary Lab as a graduate student
                researcher, where I’m considering the media infrastructures of the international festival circuit. I am
                looking forward to further integrating that perspective with the ecstatic energy of celebrating the
                upcoming fifth anniversary of <em>Immerse</em>.
            </p>
            <p>As <em>Immerse </em>transitions into a quarterly-themed format over 2021, we will continue to publish
                weekly pieces that will include ongoing coverage of the field. We hope that these contributions from new
                and returning voices spark new connections between the edges of technological innovation in emerging
                nonfiction forms and the political stakes of their circulation.</p>
