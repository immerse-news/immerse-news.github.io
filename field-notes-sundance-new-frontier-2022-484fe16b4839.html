            <p>New Frontier was one of the first initiatives from a major film festival to seriously curate and explore
                VR, AR, and other interactive cinematic forms that we now group together under “the metaverse.” That
                term entered the popular lexicon only recently, and the explosion of public interest in these subjects
                over the past year was the biggest, most tantalizing external factor weighing on New Frontier as the
                2022 edition of the Sundance Film Festival approached.</p>
            <p>Since it already had a firmly established VR component, Sundance was better-equipped than many to adapt
                to the challenges posed by Covid-19. But perhaps because it was anticipated until the last minute that
                2022 would be a hybrid, mostly in-person event rather than online-only, there was less presentational
                innovation this year than in 2021. Early press releases hyped that the latest iteration of New Frontier
                would be an innovative “<a
                    href="https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2021/11/22/sundance-film-festivals/">biodigital
                    showcase</a>.” Having engaged with many of the series’ VR experiences, I still am unsure what that
                means. The “Spaceship,” the interactive online hub used both for accessing New Frontier programming and
                for virtual hobnobbing, was largely unchanged.</p>
            <p>But then, vague terms are the vogue for emerging media, and it’s difficult to separate the signal from
                the noise as hype builds for “Web3.” Overall, though, that’s not too different from the normal film
                festival experience, in which one must work to find the good stuff amidst a field of the bad-to-average.
                If anything, it’s oddly comforting that this remains the standard even when you’re browsing your laptop
                or strapping on a VR headset instead of hustling through Park City. The more things change, etc. Still,
                by now the section is established firmly enough in the Sundance institution to comfortably show off
                increasingly ambitious projects.</p>
            <p>Some of the ambition is of the inescapably misbegotten sort. Sundance is a highly corporatized affair, so
                it’s no shock that the NFT craze would manifest in some form here. New Frontier included <a
                    href="https://festival.sundance.org/program/#new-frontier-info/61ce1fff15ee6cfc8c8dfb91">meetup
                    events</a> devoted to asking with far too much credulity questions that can easily be refuted with a
                blanket “No.” (<em>Will Web 3.0 result in new economies and new forms of governance? Are DAOs the new
                    unions? Are smart contracts the new lawyers?</em>)</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, only one New Frontier project involves NFTs, and it comes courtesy of Jennifer and Kevin
                McCoy, who minted the earliest known NFT as part of their 2014 work “Quantum.” Like everything else
                involving blockchains, <em><a
                        href="https://festival.sundance.org/program/#new-frontier-info/61ae1f7514aef784ed1c5c12">The
                        Inside World</a></em> primarily invokes the technology to overcomplicate itself and add
                monetization to elements that have no need of it. Described as a “crowdsourced gameplay
                mystery-thriller,” its narrative, about a group of AI who manage a future Las Vegas, is set to play out
                over platforms like Discord. One can purchase randomly generated NFT cards (there are supposedly 8,000
                possible unique cards on the initial offering) which facilitate user participation in the story, though
                exactly how this works is difficult to ascertain. Since buying into this aspect requires the Ethereum
                equivalent of hundreds of US dollars, I cannot report on its specifics. Nothing about this proposition
                passes a basic sniff test, and it appears few are biting, since at the time of writing the Discord has
                just over a hundred members. Collaborative interactive fiction and randomly generated content have both
                been done, and buying mix-and-match artwork as a tie-in doesn’t seem like it would add anything to the
                experience.</p>
            <p>This is, of course, one of the most persistent problems with metaverse ventures: solutions in search of
                problems. The structure of the Spaceship itself is symptomatic of this as well. Rather than explore the
                potential of an infinite digital canvas, the different spaces try to replicate the real-life experiences
                they approximate in an overly literal fashion. The mingling space (rarely occupied by more than a few
                people at a time whenever I popped in) looks like a bar. The Gallery, where one can view the New
                Frontier projects, is just what the name suggests — a virtual art gallery. One goes up to a painting
                representing a work and clicks on a button to begin it. This conceit shows less imagination than
                <em>Super Mario 64, </em>a video game released in 1996, in which Mario could physically jump into
                paintings to travel to other worlds. What does this really offer besides adding extra steps to the
                simple act of navigating a virtual menu?</p>

            <p>It is fortunate that within this limited interface, the featured artists pull off some impressive feats.
                Two works — Gilles Jobin’s <em><strong>Cosmogony</strong></em><em> </em>and Valencia James’s
                <em>Suga’</em> — experiment with the possibilities of live performance within VR. In <em>Cosmogony,
                </em>three dancers run through a routine in Geneva, documented live with motion-capture technology, and
                their physicalities appear within the virtual space. I say “physicalities” instead of “bodies” because
                their forms continually shapeshift throughout the piece; one moment they are humanoid, the next they are
                animalistic. The environments in which they appear change as well. The continual disjunction of setting
                and identifiable protagonists makes the work visually busy but simultaneously also strips it down,
                heightening the effect of the choreography. It also ingeniously uses mirroring to multiply its central
                trio into a larger cast so that, for instance, each dancer appears as different iterations that are all
                different sizes in a single cityscape.</p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FPrk608Y1ns0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPrk608Y1ns0&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FPrk608Y1ns0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"
                    width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
            <p><em><strong>Suga’</strong></em> is focused even more intently on digitally uprooting a performance from a
                fixed point — not just in space but also in time. Tracing the history of the transatlantic slave trade
                and its connection to the sugar industry, the piece is set in a volumetric recreation of the ruins of
                the Annaberg Sugar Plantation on Saint John in the Virgin Islands. Rendered as millions of floating
                points of spatial data from the real site, the space is ghostly, as if it is invisible and its contours
                made visible only within a sandstorm — or a sugar storm. The technology used results in less “refined”
                digital imagery than in <em>Cosmogony</em>, but the stuttery, hologram-like image of James dancing feels
                appropriate in this context, as she projects herself as a spirit to disrupt the ugly history of the
                setting. Though the space also hosts sobering exhibitions on slavery, James incorporates personal family
                narratives to situate this shared online experience as a source of healing.</p>
            <p>The most potent geographical dislocation comes with <em><strong>Gondwana</strong></em><em>,</em> which
                also experiments heavily with duration. A procedurally generated 24-hour experience, every 14 minutes,
                the simulated Daintree Rainforest leaps forward one year. With the details programmed based on the
                projected arc for the real Daintree forest should climate change continue unabated, the environment
                decays a little bit with each time hop. Whether one checks in several times over the course of a day or
                musters the stamina to actually hang around for the entire runtime, you will behold the destruction of
                this beautiful place in an immediate, visceral way. If the 2022 New Frontier lineup is about
                “biodigital” life, it is this piece that demonstrates some of the power VR immersion grants to
                heightening the relationship between life and technology.</p>
