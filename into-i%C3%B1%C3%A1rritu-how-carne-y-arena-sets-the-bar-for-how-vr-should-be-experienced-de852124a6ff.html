                    entrance at LACMA (Photo by Paisley Smith)</span></figure>
            <p>Yesterday I had the chance to experience Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s academy-award winning virtual reality
                installation <em><a href="http://www.lacma.org/carne-y-arena#landing">CARNE y ARENA</a></em><em>
                    (Virtually present, Physically invisible)</em> at LACMA. The project beautifully explores the
                stories of immigrants and refugees from Mexico and Central America who make the dangerous journey across
                borders, leaving their homes, and risking their lives.</p>
            <p>I was surprised by how truly moved I was by this work. It’s not that I didn’t expect something great from
                Alejandro G. Iñárritu and the ILMxLab — I just hadn’t anticipated just how satisfying it was to see the
                magic that happens when VR is given the opportunity to be shared in the best way possible. <em>CARNE y
                    ARENA</em> beautifully merges artistry, documentary, technology, exhibition design, and magical
                realism into an extremely thoughtful, moving experience.</p>
            <p>I decided to treat this as if it was my first experience entering a virtual world. I’ve spent a lot of
                time in this industry leading others through virtual experiences, explaining what they are about to see,
                answering questions, and leading them through how to use the headset. This was an opportunity to see VR
                with fresh eyes. This approach really allowed me to be an explorer, to question where I was, to wander
                freely through the virtual environment without expectation.</p>

            <p>When I first arrived at the exhibition space, I was greeted by a LACMA attendant who passed me a release
                form to sign. I’ve experienced hundreds of VR projects, and this is the first time I can remember
                signing a release. Right off the bat this made me recognize the attention to detail that went into this
                project. I was in for something different than the VR demos I’m used to.</p>
            <p>The attendant then told me that I would enter a room, read a bit about <em>CARNE y ARENA</em>, then enter
                the first room where I would take off my shoes and socks and put them in a locker. A siren would then
                ring signalling that it was time to enter the VR space.</p>
            <h3 id="7adb"><strong>Setting the tone for the VR experience in the physical world</strong></h3>
            <p>I entered the first dark room and read about Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s vision for the piece, and how it
                challenged him as an artist to dig deeper into the experiences of refugees and immigrants entering the
                USA. I immediately thoughts of a project I had exhibited with Emblematic Group, <em><a
                        href="http://emblematicgroup.com/experiences/use-of-force/">Use of Force</a></em>, directed by
                Nonny de la Peña. <em>Use of Force</em> depicts the 2010 fatal beating of Anastasio Hernandez Rojas, a
                Mexican man who lived in San Diego, when he attempted to get back into the USA after his deportation to
                visit his family. The project was created using eye-witnesses personal accounts, along with a recreation
                of cellphone footage that had been taken during the events. Audience members were invited to record
                their own video using a cellphone in the virtual re-creation of these events, forcing them to become
                witnesses.</p>
            <p>I pushed my experiences sharing <em>Use of Force</em> with audiences aside and got ready to experience
                <em>CARNE y ARENA</em>. I moved into the first room.</p>
            <p>It was freezing. I looked around and saw pairs of extremely worn out shoes of all sizes around the room.
                I walked around the stark, eerie room with metallic, sterile benches and no windows. It felt like a
                morgue. I remembered <a
                    href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/a-janitors-collection-of-things-confiscated-from-migrants-in-the-desert">these
                    photographs</a>, and got carried off in my thoughts. A voice interrupted me: “Put your shoes and
                socks in the locker.”</p>
            <p>I went over to a metallic, fridge-like locker and put my belongings inside. I waited. I was so anxious I
                forgot to take my socks off.</p>
            <p>The siren went off and I proceeded to the next room.</p>
            <h3 id="874c"><strong>How our feet move on the ground</strong></h3>
            <p>The room was dark. Silent. Expansive. There was dirt covering the ground. I was in awe. This was the most
                evocative, beautiful space I’d ever seen in a VR exhibition. An orange light illuminated the long
                tethered headset in the centre of the room. Two LACMA guides called to me from the centre of the room,
                and I made my way over to them across rocky, dusty dirt.</p>
            <p>The LACMA guides were serious. No smiles, no jokes. Nada. A part of me wanted to tell them that I had
                done this kind of work before! I’d done a museum exhibition of <em>Project Syria</em> at the Victoria
                and Albert Museum in London. I know what it was like to do the “alien mating ritual,” trailing people in
                tethered VR headsets, in a very processional, serious, manner as if it were a tradition on a far off
                planet. I stopped myself and remembered my plan to experience this project as a beginner. The guides
                told me that I could explore the space freely, but if I felt a tug on my backpack, I was going out of
                range and they would steer me back into the right direction. At this point I felt very glad they were
                there because I knew I was traveling to a world I would not know.</p>
            <p>The headset was on. Suddenly I was in a desert. I was alone. I reminded myself of what I tell new VR
                users — move around, explore, touch, look up at the sky. It’s easy to forget when you first arrive in a
                new world. I started to walk across the desert. I felt the sandy rocks crunch under my feet. I started
                to get a bit braver, moving further from where I first stood. I heard something and noticed a group of
                people were approaching me. My first thought was that they must have traveled a long distance to find me
                here.</p>
            <p>They got closer. There were children and older people, each quietly moving forward. They look tired, and
                it was dark. I got closer to them and listened as they spoke with each other in hushed voices. I wish I
                knew Spanish so I could have understood what they were saying. I thought about VR subtitles but pushed
                that thought out of my mind. I joined their group.</p>
            <p>Suddenly an intense wind was blasting — sand started flying, as did everything in the physical world. I
                looked up and saw the lights of a helicopter illuminating me and the people I was now traveling with.
                What seemed like police cars pulled up in front of us. My heart was out of my chest as police officers
                got out of the car with massive guns, and shouted at us to kneel on the ground.</p>
            <p>The people surrounding me began to kneel. I hesitated for a split second before joining them in the dirt.
                The rocks dug into my knees as the wind continued to blast. The armed men began shouting and making
                demands of the kneeling group. I touched the sandy dirt with my fingers.</p>
            <p>From that point I just kept as quiet as possible, hardly moving, as I watched the police interrogate the
                people. I felt frozen but reminded myself, <em>This is just a virtual world, this is just a virtual
                    world. You are not really here. You are not really here.</em> I got up the courage to stand and kind
                of half crouch, half crawl over to another area of the desert, where I could watch the officers’
                movements from a safe distance.</p>
            <p>I felt guilty for leaving my fellow travellers there, still crouched or lying on the ground.</p>
            <h3 id="926b"><strong>Magical Realism</strong></h3>
            <p>At a certain point, the world froze and a beautiful long table emerged. I was able to see the travellers
                sit together as family around it. The enchanted table began to shape-shift and move. A small boat filled
                with people appeared on the table and sailed across waves of the wood. People fell out of the boat as it
                made its way across the table. I remembered my film theory days and the lessons we learned about magical
                realism and borders: The space between two places, the “no man’s land,” where magic exists. This
                enchanted table told the story of the people I was traveling with — what they were risking, and the
                family they were leaving behind to go on this journey.</p>
            <p>This layer of magic is why VR storytelling is so special. It was seamless with the reality of the
                experience. This is where art brings realism to life, and makes an even deeper, imaginative connection
                with the audience. Suddenly, we are able to add our own layer of meaning to the piece and remember that
                we are just observing this life. We are visitors in another person’s real world experience.</p>
            <p>Just as suddenly, we were back in the harsh reality of officers pointing guns and shouting. It began to
                escalate. I found myself standing directly in front of an officer with his gun pointed at me. “<em>Put
                    your hands in the air! Put your hands in the air</em>!” I put them in the air as if he will
                certainly know if I don’t.</p>
            <p>Suddenly it is morning. I am alone again. <em>What happened to the others?</em></p>
            <p>The headset is taken off silently, and I walk across the expansive space to the exit.</p>
            <h3 id="37b9"><strong>Reflection Space</strong></h3>

                    CARNE y ARENA (Photo by Paisley Smith)</span></figure>
            <p>A VR project like this transports you to another world and experience. This was a full sensory experience
                — touch, sound, texture, the ability to walk. This part of the experience was exceptionally
                well-designed.</p>
            <p>You collect your personal belongings from the other side of the locker in a new dark space. You can take
                some time to recover and wipe your hands clear of the dirt.</p>
            <p>You are now in a long hallway, with a series of portals lining the wall. In each portal there is a video
                portrait of a person in close-up. The video moves in and out of focus. Each person’s story is written
                across his/her/their image.</p>
            <p>As you read each of stories you begin to realize that they are in fact the people you are traveling with.
                The creators used their experiences to build the project. They collected these stories while crossing
                into the USA — hiding in the backs of trucks with hundreds of people, getting robbed, seeing people die
                of heat exhaustion and lack of water, being detained in the icy “freezer” for days at a time. Starting
                life again in a new country without the familiarity of family and home, many stuck in legal limbo, never
                fully able to grow roots as citizen.</p>
            <p>As I heard their individual stories, my mind recalled the people I had been traveling across the virtual
                desert with. I remember hearing one man speaking perfect English and being questioned by the officer
                about it. <em>I’m a lawyer</em>, he’d responded. So much was happening, I was hardly able to take in the
                rest of his story. Another man was unable to communicate with the officers, which frustrated them. This
                man did not speak Spanish. Through his story portrait I learned he is from Guatemala, and he spoke a
                dialect that no one there knew.</p>
            <p>I was shocked to hear an interview from a border patrol officer who regrets that he had to act tough
                while seeing dying, thirsty people. He says, “Anyone who does not have empathy for immigrants and
                refugees coming to America I do not understand.” His professional role was not to show empathy.</p>
            <p>Each video and story took a few minutes to digest. By the time I left the exhibition I was eager to talk
                to someone about my experience, to share my thoughts, to hear how others felt touching the dirt. Did
                they too put up their hands in fear? Did this change their perception of refugees and immigrants in the
                USA? How had it moved them?</p>
            <p>I exited the exhibition and found myself in an empty hallway with only the guestbook illuminated. Pages
                and pages of notes are there from visitors.</p>
            <h3 id="e4a8"><strong>Personal Connection</strong></h3>
            <p>In the reflection space, it felt really nice to focus on the stories and simply listen. When I left the
                exhibition, though, I wish I could have spoken with someone about the experience I just had. The whole
                exhibition was extremely thoughtful and well planned, and there must have been at least 4 or 5 people
                from LACMA running it at a time to make it go so smoothly.</p>
            <p>To me, the purpose of experiencing virtual worlds and entering stories in this way is to bring the
                experience back into your own real world. To have it impact how you share and see the world around you.
                The personal stories that were shared did an amazing job of bringing this large VR exhibition and
                intense recreation of events back home to a personal, intimate level.</p>
            <p>I think it would have been even more impactful to share the experiences with another person.</p>
            <p>I remember when we were sharing Nonny de la Peña’s <em>Project Syria</em>, another very intense VR
                journalism experience at the Victoria &amp; Albert in London, people would come out of the headset and
                need to talk about what they had seen. To look at someone in the eye after the headset comes off, and
                say “Holy shit, that was the most intense, most realistic piece of media I’ve ever seen, what did you
                think?” Something about that really brings the virtual experience home. It was also really nice to be
                able to help the audience see where they could make a difference — for us, that was directing them to
                support Syrian refugees. In this exhibition the guestbook took on the role of the listener — you can see
                people write “impeach Trump” and “Support DACA,” and promises to do more to protect undocumented
                immigrants.</p>
            <p>It must have been an intentional choice to make it such a solitary experience. In some ways I wonder if
                it’s to bring home further how isolating it can be to be an undocumented immigrant in the USA without
                being able to find support you need, how it feels to experience trauma, how it feels when the world
                seems like it won’t engage with you.</p>
            <p><em>CARNE y ARENA</em> shows the power of VR when it is exhibited well, and treated with great respect
                and attention to detail. The drama of the buildup, the experience transporting you to a place you could
                never see in your regular life, magic, the effort to get the true stories and bring eyewitnesses and
                survivors in to recreate their experiences — this makes the project resonate deeply, and gives the space
                to reflect, to learn, and to connect with the real people’s stories. It is my hope that artists like
                Nonny de la Peña <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BbiTvd4Hcq6/?taken-by=emblematicgroup">whose
                    pioneering work inspired this project</a>, will someday have the opportunity to share their work on
                this scale, and move people with the stories they choose to tell.</p>
            <h3 id="d585"><em>Afterword</em></h3>
            <p>Reflecting on this VR experience in 2019, it’s hard not to imagine this intense experience from the
                perspective of a young child. No children were experiencing this VR exhibition at LACMA I’m sure, as it
                is nothing short of terrifying. As an adult, experiencing <em>CARNE Y ARENA</em> in a <em>virtual
                    world</em>, I was frozen with fear — and this is with knowing it’s not actually happening to me. I’m
                safe. But this is really happening. That ice cold isolation chamber is now instead full of terrified
                children separated from their families. This is wrong. We must do better, and if that means showing this
                work to people across the United States, it needs to happen.</p>
