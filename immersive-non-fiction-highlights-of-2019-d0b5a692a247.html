                        <p><em>These Sleepless Nights </em>is a “mixed reality” documentary that’s also an installation.
                                It merges
                                AR within a physical space and pushes it in really interesting directions. It adapts the

                                Prize-winning book “evicted” by Matthew Desmond and has music by Philip Glass. This
                                piece tells a
                                non-fiction story spatially and shows how using your body and immersive design and can

                                Anderson and Taiwanese new media artist Hsin-Chien Huang. While I have found movement in
                                VR not directly
                                connected to body movement can be nauseating, the ability to increase speed and
                                direction using
                                outstretched arms was completely exhilarating. I also saw the first iteration of
                                <em>Transplant, </em>a
                                new work by producers Oscar Raby and Katy Morrison of the Melbourne based VRTOV studio,
                                and was blown

                        <p><em>After the Fallout</em>, a 360° video documentary by Sam Wolson and Dominic Nahr, is a
                                remarkable
                                example of understated 360° storytelling mastery. The early cut of the film I saw had no
                                narration, no
                                on-screen text, no graphics, nothing to distract you from being absorbed into the vivid
                                and at times
                                disorienting and surreal realities of life in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear
                                disaster. An
                                immersive journalism trend in 2019 was to shift away from 360° video to augmented
                                reality storytelling,
                                but After the Fallout is an important reminder that it takes years of persistent
                                exploration to develop
                                a new storytelling medium’s native language, and to have the technological novelty
                                element fade away so
                                the focus is only on the story.</p>

                        <p>I’m excited to see journalists explore non-documentary immersive techniques. The first

                                environment that’s entirely computer-generated. Both the initial Antarctica episode and
                                the recently
                                released Machu Picchu experience also have unique techniques for encouraging the viewer
                                to explore the
                                space in a structured way, allowing the creator to have more input into the story the

                                understand the consequences of nuclear bomb testing there. The piece has interesting
                                graphics and
                                interactivity, which allows the user’s curiosity to guide the story.</p>
                        <p>I would also highlight the 20-min piece <em>Traveling While Black</em>, for its great fusion

                                filmed to date in VR.
                                It’s a must-see.</p>
                        <p>Last, I would point out that 2019 is the year of having AR available in Google search, a

                                on Virtual Reality.
                                Sure, putting on VR headsets can cause friction and the <a
                                        href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/05/sony-wins-30-of-vr-hardware-revenues-as-demand-fades-for-cheap-headsets/">demand
                                        for some headsets is fading</a> but I do believe that we have to look at the
                                bigger picture:
                                immersive storytelling is here to stay!</p>
                        <p>Immersive stories allow viewers to explore the environment, grant access to unknown
                                surroundings and
                                provide viewers with a different perspective. The market penetration of VR headsets
                                might not have
                                reached its peak yet, but it’s important to continue to experiment on the content side
                                so that
                                journalists can learn what works and what doesn’t. Only by observing users and seeing
                                how they react to
                                immersive stories can they become better at telling these stories.</p>
                        <p>While the future of the VR hardware market is still unknown, I am certain that spatial
                                storytelling will
                                remain relevant.</p>

                                explored how Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram use facial emotion recognition technology

                                decisions about users. <em>Porton Down</em>, by Callum Cooper and Don Webb, explored the

                                Virtual Reality for psychological manipulation and data extraction. Perhaps the standout

                                Doc Lab in November. On a TV screen in a 1960s living room, footage of the 1969 moonshot

                                abruptly cuts to black. Next Richard Nixon appears, with a sombre announcement of the
                                demise of the
                                mission. Using easily available deep fake video technology to rewrite a central event of

                                award, asks us to
                                consider what becomes of trust in our post-truth era and what kind of media literacies
                                we need now.</p>

                        <p>I’m encouraged by what I’ve seen throughout the journalism industry in 2019. We’ve
                                experienced diverse
                                stories built by diverse teams, technology and narrative experimentation, and honest
                                transparency as a
                                means to elevate immersive storytelling beyond a gimmick. 2019 was the year that
                                everyone (including
                                audiences) finally understands the value and power of immersive technology.</p>
