                        <p>The Bosphorus Bridge, or 15 July Martyrs Bridge, is one of three suspension bridges in
                                Istanbul that
                                connects Europe and Asia. The bridge’s social, cultural and ecological histories form

                        <p>In this interview, Tortum and I discuss the development of an emergent process and workflow
                                from its
                                earliest stages of ideation. How might collaborators develop an iterative project? Why
                                would a
                                documentary filmmaker choose virtual production? And how exactly do we define it here?
                        </p>
                        <p>Tortum isn’t new to historical reenactment. In <em><a
                                                href="https://deniztortum.com/september-1955">September 1955</a></em>, a
                                2016 VR documentary on
                                the Istanbul Pogrom, Tortum used sound, imagery and interactivity to simulate a
                                photography studio under
                                attack, offering the audience a relationship to both the moment in time and a place.
                                Given that the
                                processes around virtual production are still nascent, Tortum challenges the tendency to
                                reflexively
                                jump at the promise of technological tools, instead engaging in a more philosophical
                                dialectic between
                                object and medium or object <em>as</em> medium. His dialectic presents a blueprint that
                                artists may use
                                for their own development processes.</p>

                                collected several
                                thousand reels of 8mm film from that era in Istanbul. The film will consist of archival
                                footage and
                                fictionalized reenactments. It will use 3D models and it will use game engines for part
                                of the
                                production. Thinking from the perspective of architecture — before the bridge was an
                                actual bridge, it
                                was a 3D model — not a computer model, but a physical model. And before that, it was a
                                drawing. So these
                                different levels of representation and how we manifest those representations to change
                                reality and the
                                physical world have parallels with virtual sets and 3D models of virtual production.
                                Some of these are
                                premature ideas that I can’t completely articulate.</p>

                        <p><strong>SK: With fiction, there is a certain assumption that all works will be pushing
                                        imaginative
                                        bounds. With documentary or, rather, with reenactment, there may be a
                                        responsibility or a weight to
                                        make these boundaries clear. How do you navigate that?</strong></p>
                        <p>DT: What is a documentary? I think of any film that has its own claim to reality as a
                                documentary. I
                                don’t think there is necessarily an extra responsibility on documentary compared to
                                fiction, but rather
                                a difference in how you make your claim of reality. It’s more a question of method. I
                                value the
                                self-reflexive mode in documentaries, that hints at the production process. Within this
                                self-reflexive
                                mode, if you’re shooting a documentary on a virtual production set, are there ways to
                                address the method
                                of production? That’s a big question for me. What is the relationship between a virtual
                                production set
                                and the construction of a bridge? What is the relationship between the story of the film
                                and shooting it
                                on a virtual production set? I do sense that there are relations, but if I cannot
                                articulate it in the
                                end, I don’t think I would shoot on a virtual production set. For me, the method of
                                production should
                                somehow reflect what the film is about.</p>

                        <p><strong>SK:</strong> <strong>Could you expand on the last part?</strong></p>
                        <p>DT: In my work, the shooting method and the style generally change and react to the type of
                                scenes,
                                spaces, and relations in each scene. So the camera reacts to the things it is capturing,
                                and the style
                                is guided by the encounters. I’m thinking about how a virtual production set can be used
                                not only to
                                tell a story but also be a site of encounter between the film’s style, production
                                method, and the
                                content in how it reacts to the story.</p>
                        <p><strong>SK: I love the idea of linking the building of a bridge to the building of the set.
                                        It strikes me
                                        that rushing to define a virtual production process in a rigid manner might be
                                        about control. As you
                                        walk me through your thinking process, I’m noticing that there also needs to be
                                        fluidity and
                                        abstraction in the iterative space.</strong></p>
                        <p>DT: You need to stay with uncertainty a bit for your ideas to grow and develop. Real-time
                                game engines
                                give a lot of freedom and a lot of reversibility during the shooting process. If you
                                want, you can shoot
                                during a virtual golden hour for hours. It takes away the tension of shooting in the
                                physical world, the
                                accidents, and the imposing presence of physical laws. But it also brings in something
                                new. For example,
                                you can suddenly turn a realistic rendering into a wire-frame rendering and then see how
                                the actors will
                                react or how it will change their improvisation. Or you can change the scene to
                                something abstract while
                                your actors are in the scene. It is almost like you can immerse your subjects in a
                                virtual montage.</p>

                        <p><strong>SK: How do you make a case for virtual production at this early stage of the process,
                                        especially
                                        when it comes to expenses? You’ve worked in VR and with green screens. Are there
                                        transferable
                                        skills?</strong></p>
                        <p>DT: One thing that virtual production allows that a green screen setup doesn’t is
                                improvisation in
                                virtual environments. Because both the crew and the actors are within the space, they
                                can make decisions
                                on the spot. I believe the most expensive thing in virtual production is the LED wall
                                itself, but I hope
                                within a year there will be more affordable studios.</p>
                        <p><strong>SK: Is your main interest in virtual production that it produces heightened
                                        performance from
                                        actors or are there other factors to it?</strong></p>
                        <p>DT: In VR, especially around 2015 and 2016, everyone was focusing on the viewer’s experience
                                and how to
                                design for a viewer. But virtual production removes the viewer and uses the same setup
                                and same
                                technology to do something completely different. The environment doesn’t change when the
                                actor moves;
                                the environment changes when the camera moves. There is a relationship between the
                                camera and the
                                environment. And it is modifiable. That was one of the inspiring things about virtual
                                production to me.
