            <h3 id="6479">Why less can be more in digital storytelling</h3>
            <p>With all of the interactive possibilities now available for digital narratives, it may come as a surprise
                that some of the most ground-breaking artists are deliberately putting constraints on the tools and
                methods they use — even as the VR-extended family of technologies seemingly enable limitless fields of
                view, and computer software and hardware allow for unprecedented levels of interaction.</p>
            <p>Why would creators choose to impose constraints on their work, limiting newly acquired technical
                freedoms? A look back sheds some light.</p>
            <p>Jonathan Harris’s <em><a href="https://docubase.mit.edu/project/i-love-your-work/">I Love Your
                        Work</a></em> (2013) follows nine women who make their living in the lesbian porn industry. The
                project is comprised of 2,202 video clips, each ending—or, rather, stopping—after 10 seconds. The
                justification of imposing this constraint is the length of the teasers on those websites, and the
                project clips are abruptly cut in a similar way. While the cuts seem arbitrary, they create a unique
                style, as the project is not exactly a film or a single video but rather a new cinematic being. The
                story is enhanced by the fact that the medium is unique, and the viewer’s attempt to decipher the
                content and form is performed in unison. It is an example of how imposing a constraint on a story
                generates a new, potential, self-contained world of multitudes.</p>

            <p>Digital media has made an almost infinite amount of data available, and many stories, especially
                documentaries, are fed from inputs that need to be filtered. In this case, imposing constraints on data
                may be enough to create a story. This computational filtering method consists of two building blocks
                that construct many visual stories: data selection and data projection.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data </strong><strong><a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_(relational_algebra)">Selection</a></strong>
                    means taking only the data elements that fulfill a certain condition. In Fabrice Florin’s <em><a
                            href="https://docubase.mit.edu/project/moss-landing/">Moss Landing</a></em> (1989), the
                    footage for the project was all captured during a single day in one coastal town with the intention
                    of creating “a live postcard.” This work inspired many others. By fixing the time and place, Florin
                    formed an inner world, which allows the viewer to better immerse themselves in it and ignore
                    anything else.</li>
                <li><strong>Data </strong><strong><a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(relational_algebra)">Projection</a></strong>
                    means focusing on several attributes, but allows the manipulation of those attributes in order to
                    present them differently. La Burthe, Colinart, Spinney &amp; Middleton’s <em><a
                            href="https://docubase.mit.edu/project/notes-on-blindness/">Notes on Blindness</a></em>
                    (2016) focuses on the eyesight attribute; the project enables the viewer to feel what it is like to
                    go blind. In order to do so, the visual objects undergo a twofold projection: the objects themselves
                    are shown blurred, and they are represented to the viewer through corresponding sounds. In Jeremey
                    Mendes and Leanne Allison’s <em><a href="https://docubase.mit.edu/project/bear-71/">Bear
                            71</a></em><em> (2012)</em>, the narrative constraint is expressed through a personification
                    of a bear.</li>

            <p>Many artists don’t just impose limitations on themselves but create in an environment that has its own
                built-in constraints. Digital storytelling often refers to the presence or absence of the cinematic
                frame. On the one hand, the fact that in VR there is no filtering frame allows more freedom. On the
                other hand, the infinite canvas does not necessarily mean that there aren’t different constraints
                imposed by new technologies. A partial list of constraints in VR, for example, would include the weight
                of the headset, the difficulty to walk while wearing it, and the fact that most people cannot wear it
                for more than 15 minutes. Interactivity creates its own built-in limitations by forcing a certain
                interface on the users. Decentralized or distributed works have to obey the rules of computer networks,
                etc.</p>
            <p>I suggest turning to a different historical lineage: to think of digital storytelling in relation to 20th
                century poetry. Poetry has escaped its own prison of rhyme and meter, creating “free verse” to enable
                total expression of the self, “not in sequence of a metronome,” as Ezra Pound wrote.</p>
            <p>While free verse is the prevalent form of contemporary poetry, whether it is free or not is disputed by
                many. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_poets">Language poets</a> claimed that the new
                constraints of “free” verse are being imposed by language, mainly by the sentence (“That’s what we call
                it when we put someone in jail,” said Robert Creeley). Ron Silliman formed <em><a
                        href="http://writing.upenn.edu/library/Silliman-Ron_The-New-Sentence.pdf">The New
                        Sentence</a></em>. Language constructs—along with their attached cultural biases—have been
                challenged by poets, often by using constraints.</p>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo">Oulipo </a>is a French literary group formed in 1960 that
                utilized constrained writing to explore the potential of literature. Founding member Raymond Queneau
                published <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercises_in_Style">Exercises in Style</a></em> in
                1947, an experimental book depicting the same scene in a hundred different styles, or data projections.
                The most famous member of the group, George Perec, wrote <em><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Void">La Disparition</a></em>, about the disappearance of
                the letter “e” without using it, thus employing data selection. American poet Bob Perelman expressed a
                sudden shocking feeling by writing only the first five words of each sentence in <em><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercises_in_Style">Chronic Meanings</a></em>. Many other
                examples show that constraint-based writing foreshadowed many tricks and techniques in digital
                storytelling.</p>

            <p>It may be both challenging and useful to think of a visual storytelling version that correlates to works
                such as Anne Garréta’s <em><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Sphinx-Anne-Garr%C3%A9ta/dp/1941920098">Sphinx</a></em>, which
                details a romantic affair without disclosing either of the lovers’ gender. Such a constraint feels
                intimately related to VR or first-person visual storytelling works.</p>
            <p>Parts of digital storytelling are evolving towards algorithmic storytelling, and constraint-based works
                may serve as a portal to this realm. Chatbots have become popular in the last couple of years, due to
                the fact they can demonstrate various levels of non-human agency. They are constrained due to the limits
                of their programming architecture.</p>
            <p>Bots can be rule-based or data/example/machine learning-based, but, in any case, they serve as artificial
                beings. This allows humans to open up to a different kind of conversational being, and offers a
                comparison between humanity and software.</p>
            <p>While it may seem to contradict the passion of creators to express themselves freely, thinking in terms
                of constraints may help them to find their own free path within the infinite possibilities. Constraints
                humans impose on their creations are an extension of human behavior, allowing us to realign ourselves to
                a digital culture in the same sense that art filters reality to reflect ourselves.</p>
