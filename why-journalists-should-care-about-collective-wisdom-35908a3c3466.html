            <p>“Audiences are asking new, more complex questions about power imbalances implicit in legacy-storytelling
                contracts between makers and <em>subjects</em>. Instead, they are becoming active co-creators of their
                narratives,” write Katerina Cizek and William Uricchio, the authors of the new <em>Collective
                    Wisdom</em> field study that we’re featuring in this issue of <em>Immerse.</em></p>
            <p>While the study was produced by the Co-Creation Studio at MIT’s Open Documentary Lab, it’s just as
                relevant to journalists as it is to documentarians. Both fields are grappling not only with <a
                    href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/05/why-should-i-tell-you-a-new-guide-aims-to-make-reporting-on-communities-less-extractive/">tough
                    questions</a> about audience trust and agency, but with the ways in which participatory platforms
                and machine learning are unsettling the notion of single <em>auteur</em> as the best route to knowledge.
                What’s more, they’re learning that working together can produce better results: deeper investigations,
                more insightful accounts of political situations, a more profound understanding of the differences and
                similarities between groups that are estranged.</p>
            <p>They are not alone. In this <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/interactive-graphic-co-creation-and-associated-practices-e8c706fbc1c3">interactive
                    infographic</a>, the authors chart a variety of disciplines in which collaborative, bottom-up
                methodologies are providing more equitable pathways to tell stories, design our built environment, shift
                politics, and generate insights. Zooming in, above, the infographic identifies four methods that open up
                the doors of the newsroom to allow multiple perspectives to inform reporting: citizen, community,
                solutions, and open data journalism.</p>
            <p>Normally, this column is about the relationship between a single user and a single media experience: the
                interface, broadly defined as “the place at which independent and often unrelated systems meet and act
                on or communicate with each other.” Collaborative modes of reporting trouble the traditional linear
                mental model of news: “We report, you decide.” Now, with the help of widely available technology, the
                interface between reporters and audience members can be made permeable throughout the process: at the
                stages of story conception, information gathering, production, distribution, and follow-up.</p>

            <p>Over the past decade, news entrepreneurs have been busy developing tailored systems and models to refine
                such practices. Many of these were on tap at May’s <a
                    href="https://collaborativejournalism.org/2019/05/29/what-you-missed-at-the-2019-collaborative-journalism-summit/">Collaborative
                    Journalism Summit</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>One popular term for community-informed reporting is “engaged journalism.” In my consulting practice,
                I’ve been tracking the growth of this field over the past decade. Here’s a <a
                    href="https://medium.com/@DotCoStudio/engaged-journalism-resources-35a9be85de4a">recent roundup</a>
                of associated research and resources. But simply “engaging” audiences is not enough to repair the trust
                between journalists and communities, said Darry Holliday of City Bureau in a keynote at the summit.
                Instead, the goal should be to “equip” audience members with the tools they need to shape democracy and
                build power.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/443/1*Oz-9FZGRJjiwTHI-MAanoA.png"

            </figure>
            <p>City Bureau has done this with its Documenters program, noted Holliday, “which trains and pays everyday
                people to hold local government to account in collaboration with local journalists.” He cited other
                examples: <a href="https://outliermedia.org/">Detroit’s Outlier Media</a>, “which is using text messages
                to deliver service journalism on demand,” or public access TV and community radio stations such as <a
                    href="https://www.bricartsmedia.org/">BRIC</a> or <a href="https://phillycam.org/">Philly Cam</a>.
                He also noted parallel efforts in community organizing, civic tech, and youth education to be inclusive,
                center the experience of users, and reframe stories around assets rather than deficits.</p>

            <p>Packed with lightening talks, the summit featured a wide array of collaborative reporting models. A
                particularly powerful one: <em><a href="https://sinceparkland.org/">Since Parkland</a></em>, which
                brought teen journalists together to report on the lives of 1,200 American kids killed by guns in a
                12-month period. A collaboration between independent reporting project <a
                    href="https://thetrace.org/">The Trace</a>, the <em>Miami Herald</em>, and McClatchy, the project
                combines information visualization with intimate profiles to “document patterns in child gun deaths —
                and what might reduce them.”</p>
            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/HBCompass/status/1129418731422134272">Here</a>, Heather Bryant offers links
                to other projects featured at the summit. Bryant also presented on <a
                    href="http://www.projectfacet.org/">Project Facet</a>, a tool she’s been building to facilitate
                reporting collaboration between newsrooms. This was just one of the tools presented at the summit, which
                also featured a <a
                    href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KhB2XDWtZZrbt8cQfsoVvf6r1s-yIxLL/view">collaborative data
                    reporting </a>tool from ProPublica, and an <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uM7IOAPx4IZXlS-X5XyOX0JNS0hrhDwn8kQtpXQ3dXQ/edit#slide=id.p1">Assignments
                </a>tool from MuckRock that helps readers suggest and participate in parsing the results of FOIA
                requests. These join other rising tools in the engaged journalism space that help media makers
                productively involve audiences, such as <a href="https://www.wearehearken.com/">Hearken</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.groundsource.co/">GroundSource</a>, and the Coral Project’s <a
                    href="https://coralproject.net/talk/">Talk</a>. But as the tool-builders themselves will tell you,
                this isn’t just about adopting new technologies—it’s about shifting newsroom culture. That’s why
                initiatives such as the <a href="https://membershippuzzle.org/">Membership Puzzle Project</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.listeningpostcollective.org/">Listening Post Collective</a> are also gaining
                traction, as the compact between reporters, audiences, and other stakeholders is being rewritten <a

                    experiment at a time</a>.</p>
            <p>Given the shaky state of democracy around the world, the summit also took a look at how journalists are
                working both together and with civic organizations to cover elections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On the local front, <a href="https://chi.vote/">Chi.Vote</a> project was a collaboration between 10
                    small Chicago-based newsrooms with different strengths and skills. It provided mobile-friendly voter
                    resources such as a ward-by-ward candidate lookup tool, a Spanish-language FAQ on the nuts and bolts
                    of voting, and an email newsletter. Partner newsrooms contributed related stories via a joint
                    content management system (CMS), and a newsfeed highlighted content from partners and others. In
                    collaboration with Reform for Illinois, the project offered campaign finance data on candidates. <a
                        href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/solution-set/2019/05/02/these-chicago-news-orgs-worked-together-to-create-a-collaborative-voting-guide/">Learn
                        more here</a> and see their <a href="https://github.com/chi-vote">open source code</a> for the
                    project here.</li>
                <li>On the international front, <a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/">First Draft’s CrossCheck</a>
                    project aims to build a “global supernewsroom” to cover elections across multiple countries and help
                    reporters verify possible misinformation. Journalists work together across outlets to verify content
                    and decide if it is trustworthy; at least three organizations have to sign off before conclusions
                    are shared with the public.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The vibe at this summit was optimistic and bustling—a stark contrast to the <a
                    href="https://www.businessinsider.com/2019-media-layoffs-job-cuts-at-buzzfeed-huffpost-vice-details-2019-2/">grim
                    news about journalism layoffs</a> we’re now seeing almost daily. This is true too at similar
                gatherings, such as <a href="https://opennews.org/">SRCCON</a> and the <a
                    href="https://www.ilhumanities.org/events/people-powered-publishing-conference-2018/">People Powered
                    Publishing</a> conference, where news innovators mingle with community organizers, developers, and
                civic tech builders to imagine a more open, pluralistic and responsive future for the field.</p>
            <p>Being a part of this larger community over the past two decades has deeply informed my own journalistic
                practice. While it’s often my job as a researcher or reporter to take the temperature of the latest
                participatory journalism craze, I am as much patient as doctor. I’ve learned to question my own biases
                and assumptions, to seek input from those not like me, and to value lived experience on par with formal
                credentials. <em>Immerse</em> itself is an exercise in collaborative journalism—we seek to solicit
                perspectives from members of the field we cover and create space for dialogue, rather than just holding
                ourselves at arm’s length as critics and experts.</p>
            <p>That’s why I think others in the conversation about reinventing the news should give this new report a
                closer look. We’ve talked amongst ourselves plenty already. Now, it’s time to discover how parallel
                fields are addressing similar questions in creative ways.</p>
