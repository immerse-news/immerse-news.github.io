            <p>The Magnum Foundation seeks to expand creativity and diversity in documentary photography. Our ongoing <a
                    href="https://www.magnumfoundation.org/photography-expanded/">Photography Expanded</a> initiative
                provides space for socially engaged and community-based image-makers to meet, exchange ideas, and learn
                about emerging digital tools and platforms for increasing the impact of their work. Each year we hold a
                series of labs that culminate in a free, full-day public symposium centered around trends at the
                forefront of creative social practice.</p>
            <p>At the 2017 symposium in June, a range of creative practitioners led presentations and discussions
                exploring collectivity, authorship, and participation in documentary practice. They inspired deep
                thinking on what it means for photographers, organizers, and activists to partner with other makers,
                their subjects and constituents, and the public.</p>

                    discussed their work of creating public visual interventions to incite social and political action —

                        href="http://doubleexposurefestival.com/speaker/opeyemi-olukemi/">Opeyemi Olukemi</a> discussed
                    the building of infrastructures that enable cooperation: “Things like land trusts, educating our
                    neighbors, knowing people in our neighborhoods, saying hello to people, talking to people, and
                    having each others’ backs. That’s an alternative economy right there,” said Hart.</li>

                        href="http://creativetime.org/about/staff/nato-thompson/">Nato Thompson</a>, about
                    intentionality, asking: Who is the work being made for? “I’m interested in presenting that work to
                    the community first,” she said. “There is a lot of art out here that is pulling from communities and
                    those communities have never seen themselves in that work. And I’m very much against that kind of
                    practice.”</li>

            <h3 id="42ed"><strong>Supporting collaborative practice</strong></h3>
            <p>At the Magnum Foundation, we’re interested in supporting a range of styles and approaches, using the term
                “documentary” to ground our work in contemporary critical issues—from classical reportage to more
                conceptual frameworks. We’re deeply curious about how collaboration can expand the potential of
                photography to challenge the traditional perception of what documentary photography is and what it can
                achieve.</p>
            <p>This past year, we gave our first-ever <a
                    href="http://magnumfoundation.tumblr.com/post/153178560431/announcing-on-religion-a-collaborative-pilot">collaborative
                    grant</a>, made to interdisciplinary teams focused on topics related to religion. The grant included
                an <a
                    href="http://magnumfoundation.tumblr.com/post/153178555011/an-intensive-lab-for-the-on-religion-pilot">intensive
                    project development lab</a>, where the teams all came together in New York with a panel of advisors
                and experts across fields.</p>
            <p>Creators of two of those projects presented at the symposium: <em>Mapping the Spirit</em>, by Kameelah
                Janan Rasheed with Corey Tegeler, and <em>The Blood and the Rain</em>, by Yael Martinez and Orlando
                Velázquez. Now in their final stages of development, these projects exemplify the benefits of
                confronting the limitations of photography and being open to techniques and approaches from other
                mediums.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Mapping the Spirit</strong></em> is a digital archive project that seeks to document
                spiritual life amongst people of African descent in North America by amplifying these voices to create
                nuanced histories through a series of interrelated chapters focused on specific communities. Tegeler
                designed the first chapter of <em>Mapping the Spirit—</em>on<em> </em>the Moorish Science Temple of
                America—as an interactive website which integrates photographs, audio, and long-form interviews with
                archival matter such as FBI files, newspaper articles, and Moorish publications. Future chapters will
                explore Black Hasidic communities as well as networks of Black Buddhists.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>We were interested in thinking through the current parameters of how archives are experiences in real
                    life as well as on digital platforms. We wanted to allow for multiple entry-points into the content
                    of the website as well as a loose narrative structure. We were also interested in including some
                    elements of traditional archives, like the ability to save or bookmark content. In the end, Corey
                    designed several features that met these needs including multiple points of entry to different text,
                    image, and video material, a feature that allowed users to save and re-organize their own collection
                    of material across the site, and a finding aid with 100 other archival pieces.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>For Rasheed and Tegeler, collaboration led to an adventurous development process, as the designing and
                programming ran parallel to the collection and creation of the media. All of this resulted in unexpected
                radical shifts in approach to design and development. Through interdisciplinary partnerships, new
                artistic forms can emerge that would not have manifested within a single mode of practice.</p>

            <p><strong>The Blood and the Rain</strong> is a multimedia collaboration by two brothers, photographer Yael
                Martínez and graphic artist Orlando Velázquez. Inspired to seek connection with their roots and cultural
                history, Martínez and Velázquez sought out ancestral communities in their native Guerrero, Mexico.</p>
            <p>Over time, they were welcomed to experience long-held indigenous spiritual traditions and ceremonies of
                gratitude to the earth. Because the rituals themselves are not allowed to be photographed, Yael and
                Orlando found ways of documenting and honoring the communities’ cultural expressions without exposing or
                violating them.</p>

                <p>More and more I am interested in collaborative work, and work where the approaches to representation
                    are unique.… The technological aspect of photography has made great advances, but it is also a
                    subjective medium that tries to represent the world. I think it has also been one of the mediums
                    that has changed the way in which we see and engage with reality. So for me, I am most interested in
                    expanding the forms of representation in my work.</p>

            <h3 id="404d">Curiosity first</h3>
            <p>The symposium is a point of gathering and intersection for a range of practitioners. It is often a site
                of reconnecting and meeting new potential collaborators, of discourse and debate, and certainly of
                asking questions.</p>
            <p>With artist and activator <a href="http://www.nomovement.com/">Mark Strandquist</a>, we asked presenters
                to respond to the following prompt: <strong>What question should one answer before</strong><em>
                </em><strong>beginning a collaborative project?</strong><em> Starting with Questions Not Answers
                </em>ended up as a zine on each seat in the audience.</p>
