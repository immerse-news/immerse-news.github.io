            <p><em>4 Feet: Blind Date</em> is an Argentinian VR film about Juana, an 18-year-old who uses a power
                wheelchair. The film portrays Juana’s experience going to see a guy she met online. The film jumps back
                and forth on this timeline, alternating between scenes of Juana on her way to her date and scenes of
                them together in his bedroom.</p>
            <p>I saw the VR film at the Sundance Film Festival, where its intro acts as an emotional thesis statement:
                Juana is in the bathtub, watching a steamy video on her phone and touching herself. The viewer is
                positioned a few feet away from the tub, next to Juana’s wheelchair. Cartoon petals and waves fill the
                scene, and then Juana’s mother interrupts the private moment by opening the bathroom door. This
                introduction lays out the film’s confident portrayal of disability and sexuality, its deft use of
                animation, and its absolute delight in awkward moments before the plot has even begun.</p>

            <p>I sat down for an interview with co-creators María Belén Poncio (Director), Rosario Perazolo Masjoan
                (Lead Scriptwriter), and Ezequiel Lenardón (Creative Producer). Below are highlights from our
                conversation that suggest what this film can teach others about inclusive media-making, as well as
                making a stellar VR film.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Poncio, Masjoan, and Lenardón talked about how they came together to create the film. They recounted the
                project’s beginnings, when Lenardón approached Masjoan to make an immersive documentary following a talk
                she gave as part of her disability activism. The project evolved into a fiction piece, with Poncio’s
                directorial vision guiding the film’s voice. Poncio cites her solid relationship with Lenardón and
                Masjoan as an important pillar of the film’s achievements.</p>
            <p>The team is proud of their inclusive creation process, recognizing that representation in front of the
                camera is not enough. The film’s strengths stem from the creative team’s leading women, with and without
                a disability, working together to craft a true-to-life fictional story.</p>
            <p>Poncio and Masjoan described the process of connecting over shared experiences, while their unique
                experiences shaped the final outcome of the film. Poncio talked about the significance of working on her
                first professional project, bringing the film’s voice to life with the help of a huge team. Masjoan
                mentioned that the opening scene reflected her own tension between her private life and needing the
                people around her.</p>
            <p>The result is a film about a fictional character who feels like she has a life of her own. She is not
                just a collection of the inspiration or victimhood tropes that too often plague media portrayals of
                people with disabilities. <em>Blind Date</em>’s inclusive, co-creative approach to filmmaking
                exemplifies the benefits of telling overlooked stories, as well as centering the voices of people who
                have lived those stories.</p>

                <p><strong>We want people to feel uncomfortable and ask, “Why am I feeling uncomfortable with this?”
                        —</strong>María Belén Poncio</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><em>Blind Date</em> relishes in uncomfortable moments. Early in the film, Juana’s mother voices
                discomfort as her daughters talk about Juana’s upcoming date. Juana responds to her mom’s discomfort by
                shouting about how she wants to fuck the guy she met online. On the bus ride to her date, Juana has a
                quiet but heated exchange with a nosy stranger worrying about Juana being out on her own. The exchange
                ends with a painfully slow wheelchair ramp lowering into position so that Juana can transfer onto the
                sidewalk.</p>
            <p>The team described feedback from viewers who felt uncomfortable with moments in the film—and the team
                loved that! Poncio described the film’s use of humor to point out ridiculous aspects of society, such as
                in Juana’s exchange with the nosy stranger on the bus. She also described her goal of making viewers
                reflect on any discomfort they may feel; the team members seem to have anticipated some audience
                responses to their treatment of disability, sexuality, and accessibility. <em>Blind Date
                    e</em>xemplifies the benefits of leaning into that awkwardness.</p>

            <p>On Juana’s bus ride to meet her date, lush animations of wind, waves, petals, and organic curves flow
                past the window with magical speed, like honey in low-gravity. Moments like this are peppered throughout
                the film, as Poncio notes, not just to highlight Juana’s emotions, but also to prompt viewers to
                question what they’re seeing. What mix of reality and Juana’s perceptions is the audience actually privy
                to?</p>
            <p>Just as the team used the medium of VR to create a hybrid world, they used the tools of fiction to create
                a hybrid character. Juana is an amalgamation of real human experiences, as well as realistic experiences
                that someone probably <em>would have</em> in her situation. By bending some of the rules of its own
                fiction, the team has created a lived-in world with authentic characters. The team plans to build on
                this world and its success at film festivals including Venice and Sundance, with <em>Blind Date
                </em>serving as an introduction to a transmedia project series.</p>
