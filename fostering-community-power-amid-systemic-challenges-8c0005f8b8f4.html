            <p><em>Part IV of the conversation ended with an observation by Michèle Stephenson, that gatekeepers can
                    abuse their power by questioning the reality of the experiences of filmmakers and subjects. Here,
                    she picks up the thread.</em></p>
            <p><strong>Michèle:</strong> I’ll use the example of <em>American Promise</em>. We would not be able to
                create that work if it wasn’t for the program officers of color who supported us and believed in our
                story along the way. People like Orlando Bagwell, Rasheed Shabazz, Raquiba Labrie, [and] Kathy Im. I’m
                not saying other program officers didn’t support the work. They came later. Black program officers came
                in first and immediately understood our vision in terms of our story and on how we worked with our
                partners as we worked on what our engagement campaign would look like.</p>
            <p><strong>Juanita:</strong> I think historically, the power is in the work that we do behind the scenes —
                that nobody ever sees. Back in the early eighties, as a first-time participant on a CPB cultural affairs
                funding panel, I was shocked that white panelists were about to turn down proposals by makers of color
                because they had never heard of this particular artist or issue. And in those instances, you have to sit
                there and assert that this is the very reason this artist and their story needs to be told. Also, it is
                important to recognize the work of black, brown, and Indigenous filmmakers and producers in founding
                consortia associations to help each other’s projects get into the world.</p>
            <p><strong>Michèle:</strong> Oh yeah. People are like, “Well, I have some money. You got some money, let’s
                make this move so we can help support this and that project.” And I think this kind of co-operation
                between those with some leverage in the industry is really important to note.</p>
            <p><strong>Maria:</strong> I want to jump in here because there’s a couple of things. First, I have been
                mentored by so many, and love so many of my black brothers and sisters in positions of power, and they
                have been there for me because we have fewer Latinos in those positions as program officers, as funders,
                as show-runners, as executives in media across the board. And I want to pick up on this concept of
                co-creation as our communities color supporting each other in funding and creating work.</p>
            <p>I spent many years as Chair of the Board of NALIP, the National Association of Latino Independent
                Producers, now about to celebrate its 20th year. We’re the longest-running organization of Latinx media
                makers and many of our programs for the field have resulted in an explosion of Latinx media-makers
                today. And co-creation is absolutely our community of artists picking ourselves up by our bootstraps
                when sometimes we didn’t even have boots, and a number of years ago we began accepting non-Latinx people
                of color to our NALIP programs because we recognized how kindred we are with access issues around
                media-making. I started a [residency for women] writer/directors-of-color … across all ethnicities, and
                I still don’t see another residency like it. Right now, it’s on hiatus because we lost our very special
                (and charitably contributed) estate where it was being held. And there’s a gap because I have
                testimonies from women who attended the retreat, many of whom have said it was one of the most formative
                experiences of their careers and have gone on to do very well and to lift each other up. I think this
                was in large part because I also engaged mentors of color from our communities so that we could share
                collective wisdom of our master artists, and we also called on and honored the value of the knowledge
                and critiques our fellows could provide for one another.</p>
            <p>It’s valuable to not privilege the guidance coming from people outside of our communities who may be very
                well-intentioned but lacking the nuance that comes from our understanding of our particular histories
                and priorities. Often, the microaggressions can happen from those mentoring us from outside our
                communities not because they are trying to hurt us, in fact, they are trying to be allies, but they
                don’t always have that necessary knowledge base. That’s part of why I and some other artists dreamed
                this retreat was necessary — it did not exist before. We had a submission and review process and
                selected twelve artists from each cohort.</p>
            <p>It was such a joy to think about the specific needs of our writers and directors of color in a retreat
                tailored to their needs. As Artistic Director I poured so much care into it, and so much joy. We had a
                chef cooking our fellows multi-course farm-to-table meals so they felt how valued and cared for they
                were, beautiful rooms with fresh flowers everywhere, we had forest and mountain, fire circles and
                waterfalls and walks and picnics, and we had so much story and art and supportive criticism and deep
                elevation of our work and each of us questioned and pushed and held each other up, but also respected
                and trusted and believed in one another’s capacities. I am hoping to run that Artist Retreat Center
                again if I can find the support!</p>
            <p><strong>Michèle:</strong> Maria, there’s no reason why that retreat that you started shouldn’t continue
                to be funded. The need is clearly there.</p>
            <p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Agreed! I think that’s the kind of thing that funders should actually be seeking
                out to fund, especially given where we are right now in the media landscape. I mean that kind of
                nurturing or workshop or residency, that can really lift folks up — and also comes from a person of
                color perspective that re-orients assumptions around who gets to speak for whom. We are at a place now
                where we can question what is mainstream and who is mainstream and why.</p>
            <p>For the television series I am working on now for PBS, I was mentored by the Center for Asian American
                Media. I am obviously not Asian American but CAAM was able to actually see the value of my project and
                how it contributed to their larger goals around representation and public media<em><strong>.
                    </strong></em>Things are no longer siloed and we’re realizing a kind of win-win narrative as opposed
                to I’ve got to get mine, which is so much of the ethos of this industry on a certain level and can be
                very destructive. We’re supporting each other and giving back.</p>
            <p><strong>Michèle:</strong> While giving back and mentorship is a great thing to do and important, it’s
                also draining. It’s part of what many of us feel we have to do. We are constantly supporting up and
                coming filmmakers of color but you know, there’s only a certain amount of bandwidth. And I think in some
                cases if we don’t carve out time for our own creativity, our own creativity suffers because that
                requires headspace as well.</p>
            <p>The other thing that will lead to this idea of empowerment is more transparency in funding and how money
                is distributed in the field. Give me what the real numbers are. The Center for Media and Social Impact
                and the International Documentary Association released a <a
                    href="http://cmsimpact.org/report/state-documentary-field-2018-study-documentary-professionals/">study</a>
                last year on the state of the documentary field based on data gathered from non-fiction filmmakers. I
                felt there were some key questions around money, power and race, and class that were not directly
                addressed. And more importantly, we still don’t have the numbers from funders and foundations.</p>
            <p>It’s one thing for us to answer a survey, and another to find out the lay of the land from foundations,
                broadcasters, streaming entities/platforms. I want to know what’s being funded, also where do I fit in
                the larger landscape or field. In order to see that, I need to know from the funding and investment side
                what their statistics are. If that makes sense? Then we can get an accurate picture and have a deeper
                understanding of what sustainability looks like and where self-reflection intervention may need to
                happen to achieve a greater sense of equity and re-imagine the possibilities of co-creation. With an
                accurate assessment of what the funding landscape looks like I can make an informed decision about the
                directions I can pursue in the field.</p>
            <p>I feel the field is still far from transparent. We don’t have the statistics when it comes to those who
                hold the purse strings and power to greenlight. The studies of those trends need to come to light. It’s
                something that I’m hoping IDA does a deeper dive into so [that] we as storytellers can better understand
                the funding landscape. But also, so we as a field can render those with funding power more accountable.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Thomas:</strong> …and the idea also of sustainability.</p>
            <p><strong>Michèle:</strong> Yes.</p>
