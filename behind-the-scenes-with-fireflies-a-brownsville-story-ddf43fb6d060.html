            <p>Fireflies came together through a collaboration between arts collective <a
                    href="http://www.peoplesculture.org/">Peoples Culture</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.courtinnovation.org/programs/brownsville-community-justice-center">Brownsville
                    Community Justice Center</a>, an initiative supporting local youth in the predominantly Black and
                Latinx neighborhood of Brownsville in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
            <p>We talked to Nicholas Pilarski and Sarah Bassett — media-makers from Peoples Culture who are white —
                about the project and their commitment to a co-creative process that evolves from within communities.

            <h3 id="5a3c">How do you define co-creation?</h3>
            <p><strong>Pilarski: </strong>For us, co-creation is simply finding people we want to work with, who we can
                learn from.</p>
            <p><strong>Bassett: </strong>I think what’s essential when we talk co-creation is experiencing a mutual
                sense of humanity. It’s not <em>my </em>perspective. It’s not <em>someone else’s </em>perspective. It’s
                a <em>shared </em>perspective. I think it’s very easy to tell the story of another. I have ethical
                concerns with that work.</p>
            <h3 id="9ed4">Could you tell us more about the co-creation process in Fireflies?</h3>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/422/0*ricqOZFUSx9TRgRq" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span></figure>
            <p><strong>Pilarski: </strong>We went to the Brownsville Community Justice Center in New York City, where I
                met Ray Graham, who wanted to address the negative perceptions of his community. Ray and a number of
                other young people wanted to create a video game to explore these issues because they felt that their
                community wouldn’t really care about a film or about an animation. We set up a lab to train young people
                to learn the foundations of video game and 3D design. The lab is still going, in fact. It is a permanent
                fixture in Brownsville.</p>
            <p><strong>Bassett: </strong>We tried to partner with different technology companies, places like DepthKit.
                The participants in the lab are trained on RED cameras and in Unity, and use industry standard
                technologies, which is extremely important because we want them to be able to go out and be competitive
                in the industry.</p>
            <h3 id="7610">Can you describe the user experience of Fireflies?</h3>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/450/0*y4HoSRZBx6Kpj5NE" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span></figure>
            <p><strong>Pilarski: </strong>You play as a male protagonist and a female protagonist. You swap between
                them. A, B, A, B. They’re both aspiring photojournalists, which gives you the narrative reason to talk
                to a bunch of people in the neighborhood. We created a photo metric so you can take a picture, post it
                on Instagram for the video game. You can begin to share your experiences. You’re playing the
                documentarian in the video game, but then you have some life events that occur and that’s the narrative
                thread. Throughout that, you have to do puzzles, to find what it means to be someone from Brownsville.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Bassett: </strong>Within the game, we brought in over 100 different community members using
                DepthKit, where they’re physically in the game. As you navigate through the game, you’re interviewing
                different community members.</p>
            <p><strong>Pilarski: </strong>Due to discriminatory disinvestment in Brownsville over many decades, the
                neighborhood has experienced a dismantling of its social and physical capital. Many residents are forced
                to align with a gang connected to their housing development. The result of this is that many residents,
                particularly youth, cannot cross territorial divides. Some are unable to move from one block to the next
                based on invisible borders. So, I think there was this huge desire for young people to be able to
                virtually cross into another part of their community that they can’t physically walk into to hear
                stories of their fellow residents.</p>
            <h3 id="ea22">How do you plan to launch the game?</h3>
            <p><strong>Pilarski: </strong>The hope is for two launches. The first launch is in Brownsville. It will be
                played in different areas simultaneously, including Brownsville Community Justice Center, with
                facilitated conversations. You play the game, you go into a conversation. You play the game, you
                facilitate that conversation. We’re very keen on the limitations of media and we believe in people very
                much. We think that this is a way to stimulate that conversation. We have multiple community centers who
                have helped us throughout. And we’re working right now to have kiosks set up in lobbies of the NYCHA
                housing developments in Brownsville this fall.</p>
            <h3 id="b544">How can people outside of the community experience this game?</h3>
            <p><strong>Bassett: </strong>That is the second part: We hope to take it beyond the neighborhood. We were
                invited to a conference in Athens, Greece, in 2018. The Stavros Niarchos Foundation brought the
                <em>Fireflies</em> team out and we all gave a presentation on the project. We’d love to be able to do
                more of that type of thing. Whether that’s film or media festivals or a range of different types of
                environments where we can show this and have the community participants and the youth really be the ones
                who are presenting it, both in New York City and more broadly.</p>

                Bowie, John Bryant, Rayquan Graham, Destiny Kippins, Nicholas Pilarski, Candace Oliver, Adrian
