            <h3 id="2163">Tasting sound, feeling stars, haptic fish — how artists with disabilities are re-imagining art
                and tech</h3>
            <p>Despite the negative narratives about what we call “disabled artists” in the UK, such creators have
                always stretched boundaries, challenged stereotypes and created change. Increasingly, they are using a
                wide range of digital and new technologies to do so. As the senior producer for UK-based <a
                    href="https://weareunlimited.org.uk/">Unlimited</a>, the world’s largest disabled-led arts
                commissioning program, I see many at the cutting edge of such work.</p>
            <p><strong>What does real inclusion mean?</strong></p>
            <p>A year or so back, I went to an exhibition in Sheffield called <a
                    href="http://sheffieldcityofmakers.co.uk/the-body-electric">The Body Electric</a>. The exhibit was
                fascinating in many ways, but one crucial collection stood out: the story of Cindy, a quadruple amputee
                given a $90,000 high tech myoelectric “hand.” Did this magically solve her access issues? No. She found
                it “heavy, awkward and imprecise,” preferring cheap homemade hacks such as inserting eyeliner in a foam
                tube or creating silicon attachments for a traditional knife and fork.</p>
            <p>There is a saying in the disability movement —“nowt about us, without us” —and I think it’s probably more
                important in the field of technological innovation than anywhere else. Don’t get so high on inventing
                something that you forget to include the input of the very person you are inventing it for.</p>
            <p>It’s the same with many of the access solutions that magically come up on my Facebook feed. Enormous
                tech-<a
                    href="http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/these-gloves-literally-turn-sign-language-into-speech-1318928">gloves
                    that turn sign language into speech</a>! Wow. They aren’t going to look inconspicuous at all! Let’s
                think about it for a moment: If either captions or sign language were included within our culture more
                frequently, would these be necessary? True, they might enable a deaf person to “speak,” but how would
                the deaf person then process the spoken response? Some of the tech we are in such a rush to create might
                seem to solve a problem, but it’s not always the right one. And, sometimes, the solution causes more
                problems than it solves.</p>
            <p>Developments in arts and tech often place disabled people as recipients rather than creatives. As new
                technology shapes the future of culture, I’d urge us all to play our part in ensuring that disabled
                artists are at the forefront of innovation.</p>

            <p><strong>The importance of access</strong></p>
            <p>Unlimited has supported and shortlisted many artists working with digital and new technologies.Take
                Sabrina Shirazi’s work on <a
                    href="http://www.watershed.co.uk/studio/projects/opus-watershed-and-bristol-food-residency-2016">OPUS</a>
                — uniting sound, image, and taste by harnessing congruent elements. We supported a series of workshops
                in which deaf and hearing people tested her bone conduction gobstoppers, which enabled us to hear
                through our teeth whilst “tasting” different sounds. Unlimited’s 2012 sensation was Sue Austin’s <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IIBTTXEt7M">Underwater Wheelchair</a> (available in Virtual
                Reality, 360 degree, and standard installation formats).</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/450/1*UygVNIkNPdOxmUk5gjBEbA.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="17170397630568576586">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="17170397630568576586"><span class="marginnote">A scenic
                    image from Sue Austin’s 360 video piece <a

                    underwater (with an oxygen tank), swimming with fish</span></figure>
            <p>Sue’s work is interesting both from a technological perspective and also in thinking about access. She
                gained funds to research just how such immersive work can be created and displayed — by everyone and for
                everyone. Her team’s research resulted in a commercially viable, robust system of integrated 360°
                recording, editing and display technologies for small arts, community, and educational venues, portable
                and accessible headsets plus affordable, transportable installations so that work can be made by — and
                seen by — audiences currently excluded from accessing arts venues due to disabling physical,
                psychological, and financial barriers. Remember, access isn’t just about captions and audio description
                — although those are important, too!</p>
            <p>But, actually, it’s even more than that. <em>Access </em>isn’t just about access to individual artworks,
                it’s about access to ambition, to seeing reflections of yourself. Watching Sue gives a sense of freedom,
                liberation, transformation — a far cry from how disability is usually portrayed.</p>
            <p>Access is also about involvement. It might mean access to participating in the arts or even access to the
                possibility of being an artist. Ultimately, it’s about access to being seen as part of humanity.</p>
            <p>When we deny people access, we treat them as lesser. We say they aren’t as valued, as important, as human
                as everyone else. We deny them what they need. And this is what you do every single time you forget to
                put on captions. Don’t have time to alt tag an image. Don’t bother with an audio description because you
                think it doesn’t really matter.</p>
            <p><strong>The imagination of artists</strong></p>
            <p>In 2015, Unlimited was a key partner — with <a href="http://www.anat.org.au/">ANAT</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.watershed.co.uk/">Watershed</a> and <a
                    href="https://access2arts.org.au/">Access2Arts</a>—in <a
                    href="http://www.watershed.co.uk/studio/projects/unfixed-20">Unfixed</a>, an art and tech project
                across Australia and the UK that centered disabled artists in conversations about the intersection of
                art, technology, and disability. Since then we’ve shortlisted and funded yet more work by artists
                showing increasing confidence in their explorations.</p>
            <p>Take <a href="https://julietrobson.com/">Juliet Robson</a>, for example, who has worked with a
                meteorologist, a mathematician, and astrophysicist for <a
                    href="https://www.seasonforchange.org.uk/events/hertz-3/">hertz</a>, a multipart installation which
                makes visible and tactile the inaudible symphony of the stars and the earth’s hidden resonances,
                inspired by her insatiable curiosity and her experiences of visibility/invisibility and tremors.</p>

                    Peckett</a>, who experiences <a
                    href="https://tourette.org/about-tourette/overview/what-is-tourette/">Tourette Syndrome</a> and,
                with it, a heightened awareness of sonic access. Peckett is working on a participatory game where
                players use the “Goldilocks Mixer” to find the perfect sonic blend for a specific group, where all can
                be included and none forced out.</p>
            <p>Or Richard Butchins, who won the Interactive Award at <a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/">Sheffield
                    International Documentary Festival</a> for <a
                    href="https://weareunlimited.org.uk/commission/richard-butchins-voice-unicorn/">Voice of the
                    Unicorn</a>, an installation involving disabled dancer Kazuyo Morita and Atelier Corners, a group of
                autistic artists based in Osaka. This award recognises new forms of interactive storytelling and
                honoured the project’s originality in its approach to form, storytelling and delivery, and was key to
                the work showing at Noviembre Electronico in Buenos Aires, Argentina, late last year.</p>

                    prominent autistic Japanese artists: Yasuyuki Ueno, Mami Yoshikawa, and Koji Nishioka. In this
                    photo, audience members explore multiple video screens and a wall projection, all part of the
                    installation.</span></figure>
            <p>Or <a href="http://bekkiperriman.co.uk/wp/">Bekki Perriman’s The Doorways Project</a>, a sonic
                installation created by those living on the streets, played out in doorways. This work is not just
                perfect for visually impaired people, but, in this world of constant moving image, a provides a real
                chance for all to stop and focus down. It’s incredibly moving — and, of course, transcripts are
                available for those who can’t access audio. Bekki used to sleep in doorways herself — the numbers of
                disabled people who also experience homeless is significant — and it’s her unique insight into this
                experience that makes the work so powerful. Access is about making work accessible to all, but sometimes
                only disabled artists can make the experiences of disability accessible, highlighting the way in which
                the world appears to perceive and value — or not value — our humanity.</p>
            <p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>
            <p>We commission our next set of artworks in March 2019. Currently within our shortlist we have some of the
                most innovative works we’ve heard about to date, all arising from the lived experience of the artists
                themselves:</p>
            <p><a href="http://janegauntlett.com/">Jane Gauntlett</a> recently presented <a
                    href="https://sheffdocfest.com/films/6342">In My Shoes: Intimacy</a>, a 360-degree experience for
                two and is shortlisted for <a href="http://janegauntlett.com/truelove/">TrueLove</a>, a theatre
                experience set in Mixed Reality (Magic Leap) about ferality, social boundaries, and the impact of
                technology and data on human connection. A combination of game, interactive theatre, and interactive
                technology, it hones in on the importance of human connection in survival and asks <em>is knowledge
                    power</em>? And, if so, do we want it?</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/550/1*UJ4WFZ6JbmvoVvmmW5vJVw.jpeg"

                    headsets.</span></figure>
            <p><a href="https://deafexplorer.com/artists/john-finn/">John Finn</a> is profoundly deaf and also describes
                himself as having a degenerative eye condition. He pioneered the use of motion capture technology to
                animate British Sign Language and is now developing his skills in haptic art to create a simulacrum fish
                tank where you can both see and then “feel” a variety of highly individualized fish</p>
            <p>Another deaf artist, Jonny Cotsen, is developing “<a
                    href="https://www.watershed.co.uk/studio/residents/jonny-cotsen">Hearing Hearing” Aids</a>, devices
                that immerse the audience into the fully sensory life of a deaf person rather than just alter the volume
                of sound.</p>
            <p><strong>Shifting the sector</strong></p>
            <p>None of the works above are developing in isolation. At the heart of each are partnerships and
                collaborations with other artists, technologists, and organisations. Yet each is led unashamedly by
                disabled artists, and it’s their unique lived experience that make the work so distinctive.</p>
            <p>Supporting others to lead is essential, especially those who are different than the “usual” dominant tech
                crowd, yet both the arts and the tech sectors can often be hard to change. It takes confidence to step
                back to allow others to come forward. Is the art and tech sector ready to play a supportive role to true
                innovation and adapt for access when required? Increasingly, we are seeing organisations say, ‘yes.’</p>
            <p>Want to be part of it? Our top three tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Think about what you can learn, not just what you can pass on.</li>
                <li>Shift from fixed thinking — there is never only one way to do anything. If you hit a barrier, think
                    creatively about the benefits of doing things differently.</li>
                <li>Try thinking from a different perspective — if you aren’t part of the solution, perhaps you are part
                    of the problem?</li>
            </ul>
