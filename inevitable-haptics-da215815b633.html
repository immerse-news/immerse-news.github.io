            </h3>
            <p>In Jessica Clark’s <a href="https://immerse.news/do-you-feel-what-i-feel-cc1a3deda071">piece on recent
                    developments in ‘haptic storytelling,’</a> she performs a valuable service by chronicling her
                experiences with a range of new devices used to add tactile sensations to virtual reality. Such accounts
                are especially important right now precisely because these experiences remain largely inaccessible to
                the bulk of VR users: devices like the <a href="https://haptx.com/">HaptX glove</a> and rigs like the
                one Clark tried out in the <em>HERO</em> installation are still very much in the demonstration stage —
                and we don’t yet know if they’ll ever make it much beyond that.</p>
            <p>Even if they do, we don’t know if they’ll take the further step of migrating into the home. At the
                moment, the haptics industry (including <a href="https://www.ultrahaptics.com/">Ultrahaptics</a>
                touchless haptic feedback and the <a href="http://www.feelthree.com/">Feel Three VR motion
                    simulator</a>) seems to be trending away from domestication — that is, bringing more robust haptics
                applications into the home — <a
                    href="https://variety.com/2017/biz/features/location-based-vr-1202506197/">and toward location- or
                    site-based encounters</a>. The shift away from domestication solves the ever-present challenge of
                scaling down complex interfaces so that they can target the consumer market. Devices don’t have to be
                $200-$300 in order to have viable entertainment applications. It means, however, that such experiences
                will be confined to arcades, galleries, and other spaces of public entertainment.</p>
            <p>This doesn’t necessarily have to be a problem. But if we’re thinking about touch’s centrality to haptic
                storytelling, it might be: right now, authoring content for VR continues to operate according to
                established visualist logics of storytelling, with touch sensations just sort of added onto existing
                audiovisual content. In spite of claims that <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYwKZDpsjgg">getting haptics right is essential to the
                    long-term success of virtual reality</a>, VR remains largely dominated by appeals to the visual, to
                such an extent that Ken Hillis’s observation <a
                    href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/digital-sensations">way back in 1999</a> still
                applies: “touch or tactility in a VE [virtual environment] remains a very visual tactility.” Touch
                feedback exists merely to offer conformation of the image: “one orients oneself visually, and, as with
                sound, touch is made proof of what has first been seen.”</p>
            <p>While VR seems to offer a sort of killer application for haptics, and haptics promises to provide a vital
                missing sensory dimension for VR, haptics remains additive rather than transformative. Haptic realism
                means simply, ‘Does the tactile sensation conform to the image depicted on the screen?’ We remain very
                far from the vision <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/29094">that Margaret Minsky offered
                    back in 1995</a> of a “World Haptics Library” that would be used to inform the design of
                computerized touch sensations.</p>

                feelies and Salvador Dali’s Tactile Cinema — both imagined nearly a century ago — where touch content
                gets added onto cinematic images, instead of upending or countering the logic of visual realism.</p>

            <p>What would it take to flip the sensory script so that vision becomes the subordinate sense and touch
                takes its place as the dominant one? What new stories could we tell if we focused first on authoring
                content for touch, and then layered images and sounds on top of a haptic foundation? The stakes here are
                aesthetic, concerning the sensory qualities of virtual worlds and computer-generated environments. But
                they are also epistemic, as the rise of this new mode of haptic storytelling could disrupt established
                sensory hierarchies operating not just in virtual reality, but in media more generally. It is a question
                of how we use media to make sense of the world beyond our immediate physical surroundings — and how we
                experience the things and people brought closer to us by being translated into electrical pulses
                communicated through digital networks.</p>
            <p><strong>To Touch Impossible Things</strong></p>
            <p>Clark’s account of her experience with HaptX’s VR , a wondrously complex device that uses microfluidics
                to simulating textures and temperature, highlights what this touch-centered content might look like. She
                recounts with delight feeling a deer prance around on her palm, before a virtual dragon appeared and
                “fried it to a crisp,” accompanied by an intense sensation of heat on her hand. This drive to use haptic
                interfaces to create new and unprecedented types of touch experience goes back to the earliest days of
                research into computer haptics, when <a
                    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097849377900097">researchers</a> <a
                    href="https://www.academia.edu/5159311/Reach_in_and_feel_something_On_the_strategic_reconstruction_of_touch_in_virtual_space">used
                    touch feedback to represent microscale forces</a>, like <a
                    href="https://beep.metid.polimi.it/documents/1564928/1768793/p177-brooks.pdf">the pull of the bonds
                    between molecules</a>. A touch-centered haptic storytelling could start from the ground of these new
                types of tactile encounters and work up from there, with touch, rather than vision, serving as the
                anchor for content creation.</p>

            <p>This circles us back to the question of domestication, which directly relates to the content problem.
                Popular press treatments of haptics since the 1990s have focused almost exclusively on the hardware side
                of tech — as if haptics will instantly take off once someone invents the perfect device. It’s an
                understandable impulse: N<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sRKh3rPzyA">ew haptics hardware holds
                    a perpetually seductive and exciting promise</a>. But if it doesn’t drive the creation of compelling
                haptocentric content, its potential will remain suspended in this unrealized state.</p>
            <p>Haptic <em>storytelling</em> — creating this compelling content — also involves providing people with the
                technical and conceptual tools to author meaningful content for touch. It entails demystifying haptic
                hardware — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboxing">opening up the black box of haptics</a> —
                to see how the systems controlling the production of artificial touch sensations operate. Like other
                forms of media literacy, haptic storytelling will require competence in both reading <em>and</em>
                writing for touch. And if more robust forms of haptic devices remain prohibitively expensive, with their
                use cases limited to site-based entertainment and industrial applications, then literacy in authoring
                content for touch will remain the province of engineers trained at elite institutions, working in
                corporate settings with substantial research and development budgets, able to afford <a

            <p>There’s enough activity in the field right now to suggest that the future very well might be haptic. We
                might be headed to an exciting and disruptive moment where these new touch technologies help undo
                vision’s purported dominance, rebalancing our sensory ecology in the process. There is no shortage of
                hardworking and creative people in the field of haptics right now, both <a
                    href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/touching-virtual-microsoft-research-making-virtual-reality-tangible/">on
                    the industry side</a> and <a href="http://charm.stanford.edu/Main/AllisonOkamura">on the university
                    side</a>, and the latest generation of VR has lead to investment dollars being funneled into what
                had been a field <a
                    href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/03/novint-falcon-at-retail-problems-in-selling-haptic-controllers/">characterized
                    more often by commercial failure than success</a>.</p>
            <p>But even with the infusion of capital and talent into the industry, the proliferation of increasingly
                robust and immersive haptic devices is no sure thing. Two weeks ago, <a
                    href="https://www.roadtovr.com/haptic-suit-company-hardlight-vr-closes-due-lack-funding/">Road to VR
                    reported</a> that the company responsible for <a href="http://www.hardlightvr.com/">the Hardlight VR
                    suit</a> would be shutting down due to a lack of funding. The company cited slow growth in the VR
                industry more generally in explaining their struggles. As has often been the case in the history of
                technology, a good piece of hardware on its own isn’t enough without compelling use cases and a stable
                of appealing content to drive adoption. The future of haptic storytelling depends more on the stories we
                tell through touch than it does on the hardware we use to tell them.</p>
