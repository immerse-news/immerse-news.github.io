            <p><em>by Katerina Cizek</em></p>
            <p>New technologies demand new ways of working, according to three Virtual Reality (VR) artists at the
                Venice Film Festival.</p>
            <p>In August, the Co-Creation Studio discussed co-creativity with three VR artists in competition in the
                Virtual Reality program at the 76th Venice Film Festival. The panel,“Collective Wisdom on VR Island,”
                celebrated the launch of the studio’s new <a href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/collectivewisdom">field
                    study on co-creation</a> by showcasing three very different approaches to co-creation exhibited at
                the festival. Together, the projects include collective practices across disciplines, within
                communities, within live performance, and with artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>“When you come to a new platform, you start rediscovering,” said Liz Rosenthal, co-curator of Venice VR,
                as she introduced the event. “You start inventing new ways to make this new work. It is such an
                incredible coming together of different disciplines — games makers, visual artists, live performance,
                artists, psychologists. Creating new media forces you into this situation. It’s a really amazing way to
                rediscover how working with other people can create incredible stories.”</p>

            <p>The 76th Venice International Film Festival was organized by La Biennale di Venezia on Venice Lido
                island. Venice VR Island, in its third year, showed 39 works of virtual reality, co-programmed by
                Rosenthal and Michel Reilhac. The exhibition space is located on Lazzaretto Vecchio, a small island less
                than 50 meters from the Lido. This abandoned island used to be a quarantine transit island for victims
                of the plague between the 15th and 17th century. About a decade ago, the hospital and the adjoining
                buildings on the island were partly renovated to house a future Museum of Archeology, which has not
                materialized to date. Now, Lazzaretto Vecchio has found a new purpose in the Venice VR program of the
                festival.</p>
            <p>The repurposed island, now housing the spectacular exhibit, is in itself a metaphor for co-creation, the
                notion that these collective approaches are in fact not new, but ancient, and have been rewired for our
                current needs and times.</p>

            <p>“If you look around, you’ll see symbols drawn on the walls,” said Katerina Cizek of Co-Creation Studio at
                MIT Open Doc Lab, moderator of the panel, and author of the new <em>Collective Wisdom</em> study, with
                William Uricchio et al. “The markings are etchings from the victims of the plague who had their last
                days in this space. In this space, we also have the most avant garde selection of VR projects from
                around the globe. We think we’re inventing immersion. We’re actually just reinventing. The tech, the
                ideas, the roles that we’re creating have come around before. Collective wisdom. Everywhere we stand,
                someone has stood before us. This new technology is helping us to go back to some of reflective
                practices that we had in the past, the search for meaning.”</p>
            <p>Cizek began by <a
                    href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-1#1-defining-co-creation-an-ecosystem">defining
                    co-creation</a> as it emerged from the interviews in the field study published by MIT Press’s PubPub
                platform. She cited one of the 166 people interviewed for the study, Opeyemi Olukemi, from PBS, the
                Executive Producer of POV Spark and Vice President, Interactive at American Documentary:</p>
            <p>Co-creation is the ability for people to humble themselves and let their guard down. To create something
                that they cannot do themselves. Co-creation to me is the attempt to reach this whole mind state where
                people also understand that everyone has a piece of the collective puzzle. And jointly, only jointly,
                can we create something that’s truly revolutionary and meaningful.</p>
            <p>The panel began with Céline Tricart, director of <em>The Key</em> — who later won the Grand Jury Prize
                for Best VR immersive Work at The Festival. Tricart revealed the tensions and rewards of co-creating
                between an artist and a non-profit organization, thanks to matching by a program called Oculus VR for
                Good.</p>

            <p>While very honoured to be selected for VR for Good, Tricart admitted that at first, “When I was paired
                with this non-profit, to be very, very honest, I was really bored and annoyed, because it was a
                humanitarian subject that I had worked on a lot. And there have been a lot of stories in VR about this
                subject in the past five years. And so I just didn’t want to do another one.”</p>
            <p>But through a co-creative process of <a
                    href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-2#lesson-1-gathering-listening-dialogue">deep
                    listening</a>, Tricart quickly found with her partner at the non-profit organization “the key” to a
                compelling and unusual, touching concept around which to weave the experience that ultimately became
                “The Key.” Tricart said, “I really wanted to do something more artistic and more creative. And I also
                had an open mind of saying, “Even though I think I know a lot about the subject, I need to listen to her
                stories and I need to listen to what she has to say.”</p>
            <p>For Armando Kirwin, the second panelist, co-creation included working with humans across disciplines and
                non-human systems of artificial intelligence. For his VR experience <em>A Life in Flowers</em>, which is
                powered by the participant’s own voice, Kirwn worked with the renowned botanical sculptor Azuma Makoto
                (a human) as well as a (non-human) advanced machine-learning system. In the experience, participants
                enter into a conversation with Azuma using advanced artificial intelligence technology. As the
                conversation progresses, a unique bouquet of flowers forms based on each participant’s life.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/600/0*YjoEqV9F1J0P2W-X" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="6398909809084511550">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="6398909809084511550"><span class="marginnote">Photo of Armando Kirwin’s “A Life
                    in Flowers”</span></figure>
            <p>According to Kirwin, his approach to AI and Makato’s approach to flowers are “similar because we’re both
                trying to explore kind of what it means to be alive. So Azuma Makoto is this incredible artist who uses
                flowers as a form of sculpture, and a lot of the themes that the piece deals with, even when it’s
                talking about self-worth, it’s actually talking about your life. And it’s talking about life in general.
                And he uses flowers as his vehicle for growth and battling all of these demons. And we combined his
                expertise in these things and then using flowers with the AI, which is essentially trying to pull
                information out of you as an audience member, and make you reflect on your own life in real time.”</p>
            <p>Deep co-creation relies on respecting each others’ expertise, in this case, knowledge about flowers and
                artificial intelligence. “This was truly co-creative because I don’t think either one of us could
                possibly have predicted where it ended up,” Kirwin said. “And the hardest part, really, was not the AI.
                The hardest part was actually writing without being too pedantic. So we worked on the writing for a long
                time, and that was the part that we probably iterated on the most, actually.”</p>
            <p>The third director on the panel also co-created on multiple layers. Kiira Benzing brought to VR Island a
                theater VR experience newly developed for Venice, performed simultaneously with virtual and real-world
                audiences. Fifty or so gathered every evening during the festival for a live performance, called
                <em>Loveseat</em>. Benzing co-created with writers, programmers, and actors within the principles of the
                live performance and theatre worlds, which was Benzing’s background before moving into documentary and
                VR. In <em>Loveseat</em>, the experience happens in the real world and a virtual one in real time.
            </p>
            <p>She explains, “We’re performing in a co-creative space while doing a very co-creative production in two
                places at the same time. So when you talk about this <a
                    href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-5#4-conclusions-beyond-disciplines-occupying-the-third-space">third
                    space (of co-creation</a>), I feel like we’re probably in there. So we’re as much in discovery about
                how this works in the virtual social world. We’re moving together.”</p>
            <p>The ensuing discussions between the panelists and audience raised reasons for co-creation, including the
                climate crisis and navigating uncharted territories. Tricart and Cizek brought up the importance of
                rooting co-creation in equity and justice. One audience member had questions about intellectual property
                and who pays for co-creation. Panelists agreed that new rules need to be written, from funding models to
                ownership and governance issues — even at festivals, where there are limitations, for example, about
                crediting the work.</p>
            <p>Sarah Wolozin, the director of MIT Open Documentary Lab and Co-Principal Investigator of the field study,
                closed the event when she said, “We think co-creation allows for a more just, equitable, inclusive
                processes. It is about deep listening and working with people from the beginning. There’s a lot going on
                in this world. We need systemic change, and it requires collective action to do it together.”</p>
