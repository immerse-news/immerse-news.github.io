            <h3 id="f323">Commodifying and subverting platform data collection in the collaborative immersive online
                performance “Play4UsNow”</h3>
            <p>Henry* bent forward and spread his buttocks open with his hands on the lower right corner of my Zoom
                screen. A techno track played in the background as I spotlighted his video, enlarging it for viewers.
                The Zoom grid included masked gallery-goers watching from Düsseldorf, Germany, black video-less boxes
                with names, and eight costumed performers who taunted Henry and some other nude participants on display.
                A submissive craving humiliation, Henry decided to fulfill his fetish by broadcasting his anus via
                <em>Play4UsNow</em>, an immersive online performance that I produced with artists Esben Holk and
                Stephanie Ballantine in November 2019.

                    “digitalisation,” “submission,” and “domination” are imposed over cutout images of Lena Chen, Esben
                    Holk, and Stephanie Ballantine dressed in fetish gear, posing nonchalantly. Below their images are
                    the title “Play 4 Us Now” and tagline “Your Data, New Fetish” of the performance. This graphic is
                    used as the intro and landing page for the website <em><a
                            href="http://www.play4usnow.com">play4usnow.com</a></em><em>.</em></span></figure>
            <p>Featuring an all-sex worker cast and crew across five timezones, <em>Play4UsNow</em> utilized audience
                members’ data as a form of intimacy and political critique. In a moment when sex workers face seemingly
                insurmountable legislative and algorithmic odds, experiencing discrimination on and off-line, we wanted
                to discover the political limits and possibilities of erotic power exchange. What happens when we
                imagine sex workers as the digital gatekeepers and subvert the power relationship between sex workers,
                technology, and audience? Is such exchange a true form of power for the sex worker or does it merely
                place them in service to an audience’s desire in a different way? What are the implications of placing
                such exchanges within a public art context versus a purely transactional private one?</p>
            <p>Since the 2018 passage of FOSTA-SESTA, online platforms have been steadily banning sexual content in a
                wave of digital gentrification with devastating consequences for sex workers and erotic content
                producers. Sex workers have long relied on digital networks for marketing and self-promotion, screening
                clients, and sharing professional advice. Similar to other stigmatized communities, sex workers also
                connect with peers online for interpersonal and emotional support when coping with issues like the
                threat of family disapproval or outing.</p>
            <p>Considering the many ways in which sex workers get fucked by the system on a daily basis, we wanted to
                imagine a speculative world where we are the ones holding power. Within the marketplace of surveillance
                capitalism, power is data, and data is the 21st century fetish object. Despite a recent iPhone iOS
                update that automatically opts users out of sharing personal data, Katie Notopoulos writes in <a
                    href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/app-tracking-iphone-datacuck">Buzzfeed</a>
                that they choose to continue letting “big daddy capitalism to rawdog [their] data.” As a technology
                journalist, Notopoulos should know better, and yet, they can’t resist the pull of personalized product
                recommendations and photos of themselves found through facial recognition. They’re a self-identified
                “data cuck,” submitting to the algorithm the way that some wish to submit to the stiletto of a
                latex-clad domme.</p>

            <p><em>Play4UsNow</em> asks viewers to critically consider their own experiences of online surveillance and
                privacy through “data domination.” Commissioned by the German media arts festival <a
                    href="https://die-digitale.net/">Die Digitale</a>, <em>Play4UsNow</em> was presented through an <a
                    href="http://play4usnow.com">interactive website</a> and a subsequent live, digital performance
                broadcasted to online audiences and an in-person exhibition. Recalling a Geocities aesthetic, the
                website bombards visitors with flashing banner ads for adult services and persistent pop-up windows. In
                return for engaging with invasive questions about sexual preferences and personal details, the user
                receives an invitation to a performance in the “data dungeon,” where they are confronted by a group of
                digital dommes.</p>
            <p>Recruited from our social networks and friends, these real-life sex workers have been personally impacted
                by policies like FOSTA-SESTA. In private breakout rooms, audiences watched the dommes perform pieces
                ranging from burlesque and clowning to electric stimulation and pet play. Meanwhile, we shared a screen
                that displayed user’s data and revealed everything from their masturbation habits to the answers to
                their security questions. I read aloud passages about individual audience members, taunting them with
                information regurgitated from their encounters with our website.</p>

                    comprised of snappily edited video documentation of the data dungeon and power exchange of
                    participation.</span></figure>
            <p><em>Play4UsNow</em> did not invent<a
                    href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pg755k/a-new-kind-of-kink-data-domination"> data
                    domination</a>. Rather, this concept has evolved quite naturally from power exchange practices, such
                as blackmail and financial domination, which push the edge of participants’ psychological limits. For
                those who fetishize humiliation, having witnesses can be part of the thrill. I have demanded that men
                kneel before my feet on crowded sidewalks and spat inside of drinks that they consume in upscale bars.
                But when digital space becomes the public site of a scene, the stakes of humiliation scenarios are
                invariably raised. With a password in hand, a domme has the power to (consensually) invade someone’s
                privacy and annihilate their reputation with a single social media post. The risk is the thrill for the
                submissive; the power is the thrill for the domme.</p>
            <p>That power — despite its transient nature — is all the more relevant in an digital landscape hostile to
                sex workers who are subject to algorithmic discrimination. What this looks like in practice: getting
                your posting privileges revoked because you used the word “sex” in a caption; no longer showing up in
                search results for your username; and decreasing follower engagement leading to decreasing economic
                opportunities during an already-precarious time of pandemic. In their totality, these barriers
                systematically disadvantage sex workers, whose industry was pivotal to providing the infrastructure and
                innovations upon which the Internet has been built.</p>
            <p>As a political tool, art has the power to reach audiences for whom academic papers, advocacy campaigns,
                and workshops may not resonate. By virtue of being commissioned for an art festival, <em>Play4UsNow</em>
                was positioned as a work of art, yet it was also accessible to anyone online interested in browsing our
                website and willing to “pay” with their data for entry to the performance. While some audience members
                were, in fact, an art-going public (e.g. those who attended the in-person exhibition), others were
                curious onlookers, and yet another group consisted of seasoned submissives eager to be humiliated before
                virtual strangers. But despite our disparate motivations for being involved in <em>Play4UsNow</em>, what
                we all shared in common was our reliance on technology that persistently follows us as we follow each
                other. Our clicks, keystrokes, and scrolls generate commodifiable information about who we are, and even
                when we don’t entirely consent to the terms of the arrangement, we may even enjoy the targeted
                advertisements that appear alongside suggestions for people we might want to follow.</p>
            <p>A few hours after the performance, I received a DM on Instagram from Henry. “I was on such a dopamine
                rush that I didn’t weigh out the consequences. I’m so ashamed of myself. Are you sure I didn’t show
                anything that exposes me as a person in this Zoom call?” As is common with BDSM, Henry was feeling the
                comedown after an intense scene and hadn’t received proper aftercare from the domme who had invited him.
                I spoke to him about his concerns and suggested that he take a warm bath. He calmed down after I assured
                him that I didn’t recall his face being visible and that I’m not interested in exposing people who don’t
                want to be exposed. As much as I enjoyed the power temporarily granted to me by Henry and the other
                submissives, that power comes with trust and boundaries. And unlike Facebook, I cared about their
                privacy.</p>
