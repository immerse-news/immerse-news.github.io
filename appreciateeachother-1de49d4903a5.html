            <h3 id="75e7">A response to cultural event cancellations caused by Coronavirus</h3>
            <p>For the past several months I have been working with a team in Copenhagen and a colleague in Los Angeles
                from my office in Brooklyn to plan a Conference day at the <a href="https://en.cphdox.dk/">CPH:DOX</a>
                festival — under the title “<a
                    href="https://www.cphdox.dk/conference/making-media-matter-when-the-world-is-on-fire">Making Media
                    Matter When the World is on Fire.”</a></p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/505/456/1*zEu9u8sS5fL2fzcxyaDXhA.png"
                    width="505"><label class="margin-toggle" for="13045236371064508929">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="13045236371064508929"><span class="marginnote">Artwork by
                    James Franklin inspired by the film How to Survive A Plague</span></figure>
            <p>We came up with that title before the fires in Australia — remember those? The program explores how two
                major issues, climate crisis and the rise of populism and deepening social divisions in hot spots around
                the world, affects the documentary field and the ecosystem of support for funding, producing and
                distributing the work of independent storytellers.</p>
            <p>Over the past three weeks as the Coronavirus evolved and public health officials and then event
                organizers from Austin, TX to Thessaloniki, Greece and everywhere in between responded, I held on to the
                idea that this relatively small event in Denmark, a small country with high-functioning infrastructure
                and robust health care system, would go on.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The team at CPH:DOX is extraordinary. Led by Tina Fischer and Katrine Kiilgaard, they are passionate,
                dedicated, intellectually connected to the world and committed to community-building. They appreciate
                that cultural organizers have both privilege and responsibility.</p>
            <p>Along with my colleagues at Doc Society, we are planning <a
                    href="https://goodpitch.org/events/gplophi2020">Good Pitch Local </a>culture change events at the <a
                    href="https://earthx.org/film/">EarthxFilm</a> festival in April, and with <a
                    href="https://phillycam.org/">PhillyCAM</a> and many other cultural partners in May. These events
                are about the magic of bringing together a carefully curated group or artists and change-makers with
                funders and media partners to catalyze creating content that matters to communities. At Good Pitch Local
                we listen, and we share meals, we hug hello, we even dance. That magic simply can’t happen online.</p>

            <p>As cultural organizers, our work celebrates the best in humanity while we raise awareness and provide
                context for some of the most challenging issues of our times — interconnected issues of climate,
                economic injustice, digital surveillance, gender violence, it goes on and one. Film festivals and
                conferences matter because they provide space to convene artists and audiences from all over the world
                and ultimately enrich our understanding of each other. In times of crisis, culture matters, it offers
                meaning and context that helps connect us to each other.</p>
            <p>Notable, Steven Soderbergh’s CONTAGION is trending globally, if you want to experience hope, witness how
                a marginalized community fought to save millions of lives in watch David France’s <a
                    href="https://surviveaplague.com/">HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE</a>. In this moment, we’d do well to
                learn from ACT UP’s approach to fighting HIV/AIDS: <strong>Learn</strong> about the disease;
                <strong>Fight </strong>together for treatment and prevention, and <strong>Love</strong> each other.
            </p>
            <p>For me CPH:DOX is an important opportunity: a chance to work with leaders in our field and learn from
                them in real-time and in-person, a chance to build and maintain my own professional network. The
                disappointment is real, and shared by thousands of others right now.</p>
            <p>That may sound like sanitized hand-wringing of the privileged class. And in these moments, we do need to
                acknowledge our privilege: I’m also cis-gendered white woman living in the US. And, I have health
                insurance and get to do work that I love (from home). I appreciate that today more than I did just a few
                days ago.</p>
            <p>LOOKING AHEAD, TOGETHER</p>
            <p>As of today, CPH:DOX will move most of its program online. I look forward to being a part of that and
                helping figure out how we can capture some of the magic of live cultural events in a virtual gathering.
            </p>
            <p>Amidst the deep disappointment, and the very real impact of the Coronavirus on millions — indeed billions
                — globally, it is worth noting a shift in how we think about and create cultural events.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, we appreciate the simple opportunity to gather as a community — friends and acquaintances both
                old and new — at a much higher level and in a new way.</p>
            <p>Moving forward, every film festival, arts conference and cultural event will need to have a real, robust
                online version to accommodate those who can’t be on-site. And, in a kind of silver lining to this most
                threatening of clouds, our response will address concerns around air travel and the climate crisis, and
                inspire us to devise ways that cultural events can provide more just and equitable access for diverse
                communities. We will learn from this moment, we will continue to fight for culture and social justice,
                and we will remember to love each, albeit from an appropriate social distance.</p>
