            <h2 id="ce8b">AI Platforms for Interactive Storytellers: New and Improved Tools</h2>
            <p>At the beginning of 2018, I curated a <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/five-ai-tools-for-interactive-storytellers-43d2ff4c9843">list of five
                    accessible tools</a> aimed at anyone with basic <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>
                scripting abilities for <a
                    href="https://docubase.mit.edu/lab/case-studies/accessible-ai-tools-by-shirin-anlen/">Docubase</a>.
                I was a beginner in the field of machine learning and overwhelmed by its complexity. Machine learning
                can be a fantastic tool for creators, but integrating AI into your workflow is a challenge for those who
                don’t have much coding experience.</p>
            <p>Two years later, I recognize it was naive of me to think that it is possible to just <em>“</em>discover
                the complex ideas and building blocks of deep learning and machine learning technology<em>”</em> with
                only basic familiarity with Python. The responsibility to uncover and challenge the stories behind the
                machine learning algorithms is not on the individuals themselves, but the creative community as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>Luckily, wonderful people are thinking creatively about how we can bring everyone into the process of
                working with complex technologies. It is our responsibility towards one another. I hope this piece will
                encourage more people to join the conversation and diversify the voices that manufacture our reality. In
                the last two years, more accessible platforms have been developed; therefore, we find it necessary to
                update this list. If I missed something, or you have suggestions, please contact me at <a

                    </strong>What started as <a href="https://cvalenzuelab.com/">Cristobal Valenzuela</a>’s thesis
                    project grew into a brilliant product with a simple goal: to put machine learning in the hands of
                    creators. No code is required to play and explore. Anyone with a computer can start creating, thanks
                    to an excellent user-friendly interface. For the more adventurous ones, this software has a full
                    developer kit that can provide options for integrations and trainings. RunwayML, connected to a
                    cloud service, is constantly being updated with new models to explore and engage with. <a

            <p>The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents) is an open-source project for training intelligent
                agents in a game environment. It is fairly easy to install within the game engine software and a variety
                of training scenarios are possible, depending on how agents and rewards are set up. Unity provides
                several pre-trained environments and agents to start and play with, and there are already a bunch of
                easy and fun tutorials to follow online.</p>

                    href="https://shiffman.net/">Daniel Shiffman</a><strong>
                </strong>One of the tools on my list last time was <a
                    href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow.js</a>. Although it provides a kind of straightforward
                way for users to train computers to perform complex tasks and a great <em>“</em><a

                    area</a><em>”</em> for interactive learning about neural networks, the emphasis here is on the “kind
                of.” You still need to have basic knowledge of Python or C++ programming to find your way around. That’s
                why I was excited when the ml5.js project was announced. It’s a JavaScript library, built on top of
                Tensorflow.js, that brings a friendlier interface to machine learning on the web. There is a bit of code
                needed to browse and play with different machine learning models, but there are good documents to follow
                and some of the models are available for good, old-school web interaction. The project is developed by
                <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/itp//">ITP</a> and heavily inspired by the open-source platforms <a
                    href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> and<a href="https://p5js.org/"> p5.js</a>.

            <p>4. <strong><a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI GYM</a></strong><strong>
                </strong>OpenAI GYM is a python library that provides a large number of test-game environments to work
                with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">Reinforcement Learning</a> (RL)
                agent’s algorithms and shared interfaces for writing general algorithms and testing them. You need to
                have some understanding of Python, but the documentation is pretty accessible. The problem that OpenAI
                is trying to tackle is to remove the barrier of setting up training environments for RL agents. Working
                with RL can be extremely difficult, and this might increase engagement in the field of AI and provide
                tools with which everyone can learn the basics.

                said that GPT-3 is better than any prior program at producing lines of text that sound like a human
                could have written them. Anyone can now register on their <a

            <p>5. <strong><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a></strong><strong>, Python data
                    framework.</strong>
                Sometimes we just need a useful, efficient tool to help untangle the mess of big data so we can see
                clearly the underlying stories. One of the links on my previous list is <a
                    href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html">Scikit-Learn.</a> After playing with Pandas, I
                would like to replace it. I’m sure there are pros and cons between the two, but for accessibility
                purposes, Pandas is the absolutely winner! Pandas is an open-source software library written for the
                Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. It relies on Numpy and Matplotlib, two
                of the main libraries in the Python ecosystem. In a nutshell, it is Excel for Python with rows and
                columns. It is easy to use and a super flexible, robust data analysis, and data visualization tool.</p>

                </strong>I already mentioned Gene Kogan last time — but ML4Artist is so great that I have to mention it
                again. This is not a tool or piece of software, but a free book about machine learning for artists, with
                a collection of effective resources. ML4A is an initiative by Gene K,.mogan, an artist and a programmer
                who collaborates with numerous <a href="https://www.github.com/genekogan">open-source</a> software
