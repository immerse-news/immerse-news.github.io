            <p><em>Media innovation does not happen in a silo. It happens in concert with emerging technology, advances
                    in science, changes in the cultural sector, and thought leadership from many other fields of
                    knowledge. Therefore, it is important to understand the suite of new technologies and innovations
                    that are changing the human communication architecture and our social systems.</em></p>
            <p><em>What are the media-related emerging technologies? How will they be used in society, industry and
                    commerce? What is their economic value? Each month for the </em><a

            <h3 id="7ca3">What is artificial intelligence?</h3>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) includes a set of linked technologies that enable computer programs to mimic
                human learning, perception and decision-making. For the purposes of this article, cognitive computing,
