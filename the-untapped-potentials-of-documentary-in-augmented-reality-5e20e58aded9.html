            <p>Over the past decade, extended reality (XR) has gone from a specialized niche to a thriving scene with
                many more users and creators. But much of the critical and popular attention for these projects have
                gone to virtual reality, while augmented reality (AR) is comparatively ignored. Let’s take a closer
                look.</p>
            <p>The difference between the two forms is that virtual reality (VR) involves complete immersion in a
                created environment, while AR layers virtual elements onto the real world. Professors Elizabeth Miller
                and Patricia R. Zimmermann <a
                    href="https://www.theedgemedia.org/augmented-documentary-illuminates-politics-of-place/">describe
                    the distinction</a> as VR being “place-agnostic,” versus AR (or “augmented documentary,” as they put
                it) being “place-centric.” In many ways, the latter still feels like it’s in its infancy, and this gap
                is particularly pronounced in the realm of documentary.</p>
            <p>Within fiction AR there are at least a few breakout hits like <em>Pokémon GO</em>, while there’s no
                comparable blockbuster project for documentary AR.</p>
            <p>Surveying existing AR docs, a certain paucity of imagination becomes evident. Nearly all of them are some
                variation on historical education projects, often produced by or in conjunction with museums and similar
                institutions — what Sue Ding calls “<a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/111304">location-based
                    media</a>” or “participatory documentary.” They follow a similar format: using the relevant device
                (almost always a smartphone), a viewer can survey a specific real-world location with options to engage
                some kind of text, video, or audio-based piece of exposition or mini-experience.</p>
            <p>For example, the <a href="https://chicago00.org/">Chicago 00 Project</a> grants access to materials from
                the Chicago History Museum at various areas of the city. <em><a
                        href="https://tribecafilm.com/films/emerging-radiance-honoring-the-nikkei-farmers-of-bellevue-2022">Emerging
                        Radiance</a></em> uses Spark AR and Instagram filters to layer additional elements onto
                portraits of Japanese-American farmers who lived and worked in Bellevue, Washington, before World War
                II. The Japanese American National Museum’s app <em><a
                        href="https://www.janm.org/exhibits/behere1942">BeHere / 1942</a></em><em> </em>lets visitors
                “witness” the forced removal of interned Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor; looking through their
                phone camera, one can watch reenactments of the event layered onto the space outside the museum. The <a
                    href="http://3dfreedomfighters.com/">Freedom Fighter</a> app lets one view an animated rendering of
                civil rights leader Dr. Lillie May Carroll Jackson talking about her life and activism at locations
                around Baltimore. More of these experiences exist for everything from the sites of Spain’s <a
                    href="https://dotdot.studio/project/pilgrim/">Camino de Santiago pilgrimage</a> to <a
                    href="https://hiddenhistoriesjtown.org/">San Jose’s Japantown</a>.</p>
            <p>Befitting their educational origins, these projects feel very much like extensions of the traditional
                informational placards which accompany museum exhibits and artifacts. Rather than meaningfully
                transforming one’s understanding of a site, they tend to simply add more information to absorb. Often,
                they require more passive activity than XR usually entails — holding up one’s phone to watch or read, or
                having it at your side to listen. Sometimes they seem simply to exist out of convenience, an alternative
                to erecting physical installations on a site.</p>
            <p>Notably, many of these apps are designed as methods of historical corrective, highlighting the
                experiences of groups whose stories have traditionally been ignored by mainstream educational curricula
                and institutions. This use seems paired to the idea of XR being an “empathy machine.” However, that
                concept requires a more immersive and evocative experience. The assumption that audiovisual materials
                beyond standard text have more perceived power and can draw in an audience presumed to otherwise have
                less interest in these stories is fraught, and one that could easily step over the line of good taste.
                Already there are <a
                    href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/10/1089652445/museums-turn-to-immersive-tech-to-preserve-the-stories-of-aging-holocaust-surviv">Holocaust-based
                    AR experiences</a> that toe the line of historical misery rubbernecking.</p>
            <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26059641">history of writing about AR over the last
                    20 years</a>, scholars repeatedly speak to the “promise” it holds, without always being able to cite
                many concrete examples of work that demonstrate that promise. That’s shifting somewhat. Comparing two
                articles addressing AR at Documentary.org from <a
                    href="https://www.documentary.org/feature/augmented-realitys-documentary-potential">2018</a> by Sue
                Ding and then <a
                    href="https://www.documentary.org/online-feature/ar-vr-documentary-every-reality">2022</a> by
                Bedatri Choudhury, the newer one can at least point to more projects.</p>
            <p>This isn’t to suggest that AR doesn’t hold great promise. This is perhaps more a symptom of the form
                still being in its infancy and something we will explore as we develop more expansive technology and
                ways of interacting with the medium. Some AR documentary projects do more to engage users directly,
                rather than passively pushing them “through” their surroundings.</p>
            <p>The NYC-based edtech company Movers and Shakers is devoted to these kinds of projects, with their app <a
                    href="https://www.shakers.tech/kinfolk">Kinfolk</a> allowing one to digitally place monuments to
                Black, Brown, Indigenous, and/or queer historical figures onto real spaces, combining education and
                documentary with activist reclamation of public space. Miller and Zimmermann cite, among other projects,
                Tamiko Thiel’s 2018 piece “<a href="https://tamikothiel.com/unexpectedgrowth/">Unexpected Growth</a>,”
                which evoked the threat of ocean pollution by animating a digital tumor on the Whitney Museum that would
                evolve and spread in response to both weather conditions and the gaze of visitors. Nancy Baker’s <em><a
                        href="https://tribecafilm.com/films/mushroom-cloud-nyc-rise-2022">Mushroom Cloud NYC /
                        RISE</a></em><em> </em>projects a nuclear explosion over New York’s skyline, an intimidating and
                visceral evocation of the danger of climate change.</p>
            <p>There’s also some interesting potential in the AR features of social media apps. As Chase DiBenedetto
                explains, businesswoman Kristen Cuneo used her husband’s TikTok account to <a
                    href="https://mashable.com/article/viral-tiktok-parental-leave">share her experiences as a new
                    mother</a>. Her series of videos featured heavily quantified information she collected around
                feedings, diaper changes, and the like — all of which her coworkers could interact with in real time by
                scanning embedded QR codes.</p>
            <p>Gradually but surely, we are seeing this format blossom, as creators get a grasp on the possibilities
                offered by interactive elements. One key appears to be recognizing that a “place-centric” medium can be
                explored in ways beyond merely adding digital facets to a location that could just as easily be physical
                ones. Kinfolk, Baker, and Thiel’s projects actively transform public spaces. Cuneo’s social sharing
                invites participation from users at their own pace. <em>Pokemon GO </em>became hugely popular by letting
                players reimagine the mundane outdoors as a science fiction hunting ground. One could imagine the
                documentary form similarly taking advantage of augmented reality.</p>
