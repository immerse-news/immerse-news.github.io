            <p>Imisi 3D is an Extended Reality (XR) creation lab focused on building the XR ecosystem in Nigeria and
                beyond. Imisi 3D is dedicated to growing a community of African AR/VR creators and providing educational
                and engagement experiences. Imisi 3D is led by the inimitable <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/Judithoko">Judith Okonkwo</a>, who produced a pan-African VR hackathon in
                2018 (no mean feat!) and is also the creator of the AR/VR Africa group on Facebook. (We have been
                working with Imisi 3D on one of our Electric South VR projects, based in Lagos.) Africa really needs
                these kinds of hubs to cultivate AR/VR and other immersive media on the continent. More, please!</p>

            <p>If you are interested in journalism, human rights, civil society, and philanthropy, I highly recommend
                following the work of Sameer Padania. He has had stints at organizations like WITNESS and Open Society
                Foundations, in addition to his consulting work. His experience is wide-ranging and he matches great
                curiosity with intellectual rigor. See for example this guide he wrote for <a
                    href="http://www.ariadne-network.eu/introduction-funding-journalism-media/">funders interested in
                    supporting journalism and media</a>. If you want to dig into more reports like this, follow Sameer

            <p>Artful Spark is “a creative community exploring cross-artform collaboration.” Based in London, Artful
                Spark events bring together artists, inventors, writers, directors, coders, content producers, and
                commissioners to talk practical details, share inspiration and unpick their process. These kinds of
                interdisciplinary, collaborative networks are something I really value in my work so I’m very excited to
                follow what the members of Artful Spark are, ahem, sparking with their events.</p>

            <p>2019 marks the second year of the Sandbox Immersive Festival in Qingdao, China. The festival includes a
                showcase of virtual and mixed reality work, alongside a conference, networking, and project pitching. In
                its inaugural year the festival had an impressive guest list from all over the world. At
                <em>Immerse</em> we are constantly trying to make sure that we are covering immersive media with a more
                global perspective and I am very much looking forward to attending Sandbox this year for the first time.
