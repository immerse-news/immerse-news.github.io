                    stories?</strong></h3>
            <p>For me personally, doing stories with social data and finding personal stories within it has been
                something I’ve been <a
                    href="https://medium.com/@lamthuyvo/you-and-me-as-data-points-958ed4723f51?source=linkShare-f14f04768823-1487267815">tinkering
                    with a lot</a> and being funded to do this for an entire year is giving me so much space to truly
                think of the types of stories that lay dormant in the vast amount of data we produce as everyday
                consumers.</p>
            <p>On a grander scheme I’m becoming increasingly interested in attention management, finding, forging and
                merging audiences, and being able to communicate with them. On some level, that may happen through
                technology: I think that APIs like Twilio, for instance, that allow us to communicate with people’s
                phones are incredibly exciting and haven’t been fully leveraged by a number of news organizations yet. I
                also think journalists will need to be forced to think in more holistic ways about their audiences:
                about their audiences’ immediate geographic community, the means they use to receive stories and what
                makes up their information universe.</p>
            <h3 id="ddbc"><strong>Which of your own projects are you really proud of?</strong></h3>

            <p>With <a
                    href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lamvo/heres-what-it-feels-like-to-be-trolled-in-trumps-america?utm_term=.reJV0yRzL#.ouoLWaAER">this
                    story</a> I really tried to marry two storytelling modes that I often see segregated: the
                intellectual understanding of a larger context that data and graphics deliver and the immersive power of
                the point of view that linear storytelling and the moving image convey.</p>
            <h3 id="746c"><strong>How do you balance innovation with financial and audience realities?</strong></h3>
            <p>Attention is so so hard to garner, foster and most importantly maintain. And, as is the case with so much
                social media, the loudest will often be the ones who get your attention, even if it’s for just a tweet
                or a Facebook post at a time.</p>
            <p>In an industry that first learned to rely on the click before it looked to the subscriber to fund its
                journalism, it felt and sometimes still feels like a lot of editors want you to just scream louder with
                your headline, your hot take, or your promo images. But I do hope that through these labs, and the
                potential success of the longer-term projects, we can make the case that that extra little bit of time
                is worth it to our readers and will hook them enough to come back and stay longer.</p>
