            <p><em>by Amy Rose</em></p>
            <p>Augmented Reality is the name given to a layering technique enabled by recent technological developments.
                It is a broad and bizarre umbrella — encompassing Snapchat lenses that turn your head into a cucumber,
                Instagram filters that perfect your imperfect skin and immersive audio “grime rap operas” triggered by
                your movement through a place.</p>
            <p>As smart phones develop, the kind of layering develops. To put it simply, adding on top of what you can
                see is easy and taking anything away is hard. Of course, it is only a matter of time before this
                changes.</p>
            <p>In 2020, Augmented Reality was given an unexpected boost.</p>
            <p>While live events disappeared with barely a trace, interest spiked in “access-anywhere” culture and
                entertainment. This encouraged a boom in home-based subscription services, like Netflix. It also
                increased reliance on digital devices, particularly smartphones, as the route to culture and
                togetherness — and refocused our gaze at the street as a place to do things.</p>
            <p>The street, in fact, isn’t quite what it was in 2019. There is a sense of safety in being outside that is
                peculiar to the pandemic, though the ambiguity of this idea of safety is critical. One person’s
                blissfully airy pavement is another person’s site of potential harassment and violence.</p>
            <p>Despite (or perhaps alongside) this ambiguity, AR can flourish on these streets. What can be unearthed by
                a carefully chosen and crafted layer? What can be said — that is palpable, but unsaid?</p>
            <p>Holding these complexities in mind, I stand with a small group in Central London. It is November 2020 —
                cold, but dry and the lights are bright. People are lounging. Central London has a buzz about it in the
                evenings.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/988/1*AFrMqqA90CESlIIxLbkuWQ.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="7412383223730738320">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="7412383223730738320"><span class="marginnote">Assistant
                    Producer Sahar Malik underneath a statue of James II in Trafalgar Square</span></figure>
            <p>We are looking at a statue of James II — smaller than Nelson on his nearby giant column, James is just in
                front of the National Gallery next to Trafalgar Square. The lawn is perfectly manicured. King of England
                for just three years (1685–88), he was Lord Admiral of the Navy for decades and the first leader of the
                Royal African Company. By the 1680s, the RAC was transporting around 5000 enslaved people every year to
                markets in the Caribbean.</p>
            <p>This man made of metal, dressed up to look like a triumphant Caesar, stands on a plinth made of stone.
                There is no mention of the RAC on the plinth. Sahar, our assistant producer, tells us that many of the
                enslaved people taken by the RAC were branded with the letters DoY on their chests. James was the Duke
                of York. The group is mostly people of colour and the chill is tangible as the word branding hangs in
                the air.</p>
            <p>We are trying to work out how to communicate the story of this man. What details bring it into sharp
                relief — bring him into our present presence? How do we honour the connection between his story and the
                story of the England we live in now?</p>
            <p>And for now — what can AR as a medium offer this sort of challenge?</p>
            <h2 id="eb9b"><strong>From Augmentation to Subversion</strong></h2>
            <p>Calling Augmented Reality a layering technique comes at it from a technical perspective, rather than a
                perspective that prioritises experience or meaning.</p>
            <p>What is the “reality” at play in Trafalgar Square, gazing up at James II? One of the realities is that I
                could, soon, get ten years in jail for vandalising his form. And what is “augmentation?” What does it
                enable in our experience of the place?</p>
            <p>Augmentation brings up associations of Botox and plastic surgery — just a little bit of something extra
                to plump out the cheeks. But what if AR is a way of reframing or challenging your relationship with a
                place? A medium that provides an alternative, slightly skew-whiff perspective on the apparent rules and
                stories at play.</p>
            <p>From <em>Frankenstein</em> to <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em>, speculative fiction novels have long
                offered a lens through which we can gaze at ourselves — and subvert the norms by which we live. Perhaps
                Augmented Reality is a new form of speculative fiction that allows us to perceive the possible or actual
                dynamics bubbling along, the cucumber heads we are all secretly hiding.</p>
            <p>If we treat it like this — how does it affect our starting position, as makers? What is worth unearthing
                — and how can this help us tackle the unseen forces that impact our lives?</p>
            <p>In a way, this is a rethink of what non-fiction means. If the experience demands participation in
                something that happens in public space — a real experience in a real place — it is hard to call it
                fiction. Something else is at play, some other category developing. Perhaps speculative non-fiction is
                more appropriate for this new form.</p>
            <h2 id="3eca"><strong>The Battle Between Ears and Eyes</strong></h2>
            <p>The development of visual AR is at its most fast-moving and ubiquitous on Snapchat and Instagram. Both
                platforms specialise in ephemeral content. You look, you swipe, you close the app. While it’s
                entertaining to see yourself with a dog’s nose, these moments flit past on the wind. Institutions have
                taken organized visual AR outdoor “exhibitions” and the Smithsonian has digitised its objects so you can
                conjure the skeleton of a dinosaur wherever you are.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/750/1*OdrBCKtrfL8W78Hidj6Plg.jpeg"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="12250596511571610279">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="12250596511571610279"><span class="marginnote">AR filter
                    from the Smithsonian Museum on Instagram</span></figure>
            <p>Audio AR is something else. With longer roots that touch artists from <a
                    href="https://cardiffmiller.com">Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller</a> to <a
                    href="https://duncanspeakman.net">Duncan Speakman</a>, sound works for public spaces have been under
                construction for decades, long before the GPS-enabled smart phone became pervasive.</p>
            <p>Often categorised as an “accompanying medium” — implying that it’s not the main event and you can still
                get on with the important business of living — sound hits us, soaks in and resides within us in a
                profoundly different manner to the visual. Sound in public space can subvert the built environment in a
                way that invites a different sort of engagement than an AR filter.</p>
            <p>Unlike looking at a tiny screen, the freedom given by listening enables a form of engagement that is more
                languid and gives more agency — you can wander around, and the movement of your body becomes an element
                of your experience. The frame itself shifts — from a carefully composed window to an internal
                perspective that casts the world in a different light.</p>

                    established in 2010 as a framework for the collaborations of Duncan Speakman, Sarah Anderson and
                    Emilie Grenier</span></figure>
            <h2 id="3400"><strong>The Rules of the Space</strong></h2>
            <p>From fancy bridges to pedestrianised shopping centres, many urban public spaces are owned by <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/24/revealed-pseudo-public-space-pops-london-investigation-map">private
                    companies</a> who police them with security guards in branded high-vis. Invisible rules govern these
                ostensibly “public” spaces.</p>
            <p>This matters if the intention is to subvert or unearth the realities at play. Certain kinds of public art
                have often been installed hand-in-hand with the regeneration of urban areas but, as friendly as the
                street furniture looks, the rights of private property (and those who own it) are sacrosanct across the
                Western capitalist world. You and your rights are as important as a speck of dust in comparison.</p>
            <p>The “subtle mobs” by <a href="https://duncanspeakman.net">Duncan Speakman</a> are a great example of work
                that manages to be subversive and expansive in this context of contested public space. With a subtle
                mob, you download the audio and then turn up in a specific place at a specific time — and listen. You’re
                hiding in plain sight, on headphones. The work is invisible.</p>
            <h2 id="a131"><strong>Who are These Publics?</strong></h2>
            <p>It should be more clear than ever before that the way someone feels in a public space can vary
                dramatically, based on their personal identity and perspective. And the pandemic has intensified these
                dynamics — with fears of the unknown Other and the germs they carry layering on top of the already
                complex Otherings at play in any public space.</p>
            <p>It’s easy for artists to underestimate these simmering human dynamics. What is embarrassing? What is
                exciting? How do those passing strangers make you feel?</p>
            <p>What if these powerful sensations are recognized or integrated into the design of a piece? Giving people
                permission to feel what they feel and then move beyond it into a space slightly unfamiliar — this sense
                of a welcome matters to an audience member in an uncontrolled space.</p>

            <p>As debate rages across the UK about what is permissible in public space (and what sentences we might be
                subjected to if we actively disagree with the curation of those public spaces), the role of the digital
                seems increasingly important. In this context, Augmenting Reality by subverting the dominant stories of
                a place is a way of occupying a liminal edgeland zone in the public conversation.</p>
            <p>Back in Trafalgar Square, we discuss the challenge of telling a complex story on a device that is often
                associated with ephemeral content — as well as working within the limitations of the current
                technologies available to most people.</p>
            <p>The original plan was to digitally disrupt the image of James by setting him on fire or melting him into
                a pool of blood. With the reality of normal smart phones fully explored (those that most people have,
                rather than the latest iPhone), the conversation turns to sound and what is in the air around this relic
                of our Imperial age of conquest and violence.</p>
            <p>The project becomes about the ghosts that haunt the air around him — the ghosts of England, wailing their
                laments, infiltrating our dreams.</p>
            <p><strong><a href="http://www.ghostsofsolidair.com/">Ghosts of Solid Air</a></strong> is an interactive
                story about the statues we live with — and the ghosts that haunt them. Who are the ghosts of England?
                And who could they be — if you took control of the story? This interactive AR app invites you to act, to
                play and to disrupt the stony figures we find on pedestals across our pavements. Currently in
                development at <a href="https://weareanagram.co.uk/">Anagram</a> and co-created with a group of
                non-professional community producers, it will be launched in 2022. Funded by a grant from the Arts and
                Humanities Research Council and co-produced with Dr Colin Sterling (UCL &amp; University of Amsterdam).
