            <p>Roger Kenny wants to propel you <em>into</em> the news.</p>
            <p>Last November, the head of virtual reality for <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>and Dow Jones <a
                    href="https://www.dowjones.com/press-room/wall-street-journal-vr-app-launches-daydream/">invited
                    readers</a> to strap on a <a href="https://vr.google.com/daydream/">Google Daydream</a> headset,
                stand in a virtual living room inside a virtual Manhattan skyscraper and view live market data as well
                as breaking news stories all with a swing of the head and a swipe of the handset.</p>
            <p>“Our thinking from the beginning was to build a platform that was live news in VR,” says Kenny, who is
                part of a team of 12 in the Dow Jones Innovation Lab. His team is building the Daydream app as well as
                holding workshops and prototyping market data experiences in augmented reality on Microsoft’s <a
                    href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us">HoloLens</a> and Google’s <a
                    href="https://get.google.com/tango/">Tango</a> app. “The Innovation Lab is tasked with doing risky
                things and that puts pressure on everyone else to step up their game and do more interesting things.”

            <p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> is part of a wave of news organizations experimenting with 360 video and
                virtual reality. It’s one of the few serious enough about these platforms and storyforms to incorporate
                a skunkworks laboratory to tinker with new tools and techniques.</p>
            <p>But it’s not only legacy newsrooms like the <em>WSJ</em> that are ponying up the resources to build these
                research and development arms. Similar laboratories have sprung up at newer media companies such as
                <em>Vox</em> and <em>BuzzFeed</em>, too, all dedicated to conveying stories in innovative ways using the
                latest technology to attract — and hopefully retain — new audiences. What newsrooms are learning is that
                while in-house laboratories can help develop new ways of storytelling, outside partners like game design
                and virtual reality production studios also are eager to lend a hand and tell news stories using the
                state of the art.
            </p>
            <p><strong>At the labs, many choices for experiments</strong></p>
            <p>Last June, during the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, BuzzFeed sent a 360-degree camera to a
                Donald Trump rally in San Jose, California, capturing and <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/videos/1163551570332526/">broadcasting</a> a <a
                    href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Donald-Trump-Rally-in-San-Jose-Draws-Protesters-381728251.html">rambunctious</a>
                protest outside the city’s convention center for tens of thousands of viewers on Facebook.</p>
            <p>The rig used to film the protest was custom-designed and 3D-printed by Ben Kreimer, an inaugural fellow
                at the BuzzFeed <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/openlab">Open Lab</a> for Journalism, Technology, and
                the Arts, a research and development arm founded in 2015 that hosts five fellows for year-long projects.
                Over his tenure at the lab, Kreimer helped develop BuzzFeed’s 360 camera rig with two GoPro cameras
                before a reliable, off-the-shelf version had hit the market. He also conducted experiments strapping
                cameras to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/benkreimer/360-video-with-a-drone">drones</a> and
                converting video into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVmUy2eP-4">3D virtual worlds</a>.</p>
            <p>“After buying all the tools and equipment… I immediately began working on 360 video and VR storytelling,
                before it exploded in popularity,” says Kreimer, who has since left the organization.</p>
            <p>But now, the lab is tacking in a different direction. Amanda Hickman, director of the Open Lab, says that
                while they have made “a lot of headway” with 360 video, the projects she currently sees having the most
                potential at BuzzFeed are “playing with new ways to apply machine learning to creating narratives from
                image collections and looking for ways to repurpose obsolete electronics into discrete wearable
                cameras.”</p>

                        Thuy Vo/BuzzFeed Open Lab</em></span></figure>
            <p>Hickman says they’re also looking through social data for stories, with two examples being Lam Thuy Vo
                and Charlie Warzel’s <a
                    href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lamvo/this-is-what-facebooks-filter-bubble-actually-looks-like">juxtaposition</a>
                of two Facebook Live feeds of a Donald Trump speech and their <a
                    href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/trumps-information-universe?utm_term=.dmVWrzLNLJ#.cg4aNxErEX">recent
                    analysis</a> of the URLs Trump has tweeted since he launched his Presidential campaign. The latter,
                by dissecting more than 20,000 Trump tweets, found that Trump heavily shared links to Breitbart,
                Newsmax, Conservative Treehouse and other “right-leaning, hyper-partisan sites and opinion blogs.” The
                Lab also recently launched a <a
                    href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/cathydeng/listen-to-immigrants-experiences-on-our-story-hotline?utm_term=.nvlq2mEmB#.ftRyVoGoL">telephone
                    hotline</a> for listeners to hear crowdsourced stories of immigrant experiences.</p>
            <p>For his part, Kreimer, who calls himself a journalism technologist, is glad BuzzFeed allowed him to
                tinker and build useful tools for its reporters. But, as with any new technology, it wasn’t always
                smooth sailing. Reporters are busy people, he admits, and the technology sometimes stopped working.
                “Execution time and uncertain outcomes are challenges that arise when using new tools in a newsroom,” he
                says.</p>
            <p>Kelsey Scherer is mindful of those technological hiccups and newsroom pressures, too. A senior product
                designer at <a
                    href="https://storytelling.voxmedia.com/2016/7/12/12148256/introducing-the-vox-media-storytelling-studio">Vox
                    Media’s Storytelling Studio</a>, Scherer is part of a team of eight engineers and designers
                developing new ways of telling stories across Vox Media’s editorial brands, which include Vox, Recode,
                Curbed and Eater. Thankfully, she says, her team is given a long leash to work through those hiccups.

            <p>Born out of Vox Media’s Product division, the Storytelling Studio employs frequent user testing and rapid
                iteration, mostly with nimble front-end web development. A recent <em><a
                        href="https://storytelling.voxmedia.com/2016/11/3/13501198/integrating-dynamic-data-narrative-storytelling">Curbed</a></em><a

                    feature</a> on U.S. cities, for example, employed location-based data to personalize the stories to
                the reader’s IP address. Last summer, the studio planned and built a seven-part multimedia package of
                Vox’s <a
                    href="https://storytelling.voxmedia.com/2016/7/19/12159680/behind-the-scenes-of-the-hillary-clinton-interview">Hillary
                    Clinton interview</a>, which involved <a
                    href="https://storytelling.voxmedia.com/2016/7/19/12159680/behind-the-scenes-of-the-hillary-clinton-interview">pre-planning</a>,
                coverage and design with site editor Ezra Klein before he sat down with Clinton. Bringing colleagues
                into the process early on was key to the project’s success.</p>
            <p>Only a few months old, the Storytelling Studio hasn’t yet done anything with augmented or virtual
                reality, Scherer admits, but it <em>did</em> recently partner with American University’s <a
                    href="http://www.american.edu/gamelab/">Game Lab</a> to develop a <a
                    href="http://www.polygon.com/a/final-fantasy-7/battle-trivia">quiz</a> that was embedded within an
                <a href="http://www.polygon.com/a/final-fantasy-7">oral history of Final Fantasy 7</a>, produced for Vox
                Media’s video game news site Polygon.
            </p>
            <p>One brainstorming session led to the question, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool to make a game?” explains Scherer.
                “We found a way for all of us to work together to make a concept of a quiz-like game that could be
                inserted into the story.” Game developers, in fact, are no strangers to collaborating with newsrooms.
                <em>Al Jazeera</em>, for instance, <a
                    href="http://www.storybench.org/four-tips-on-gamifying-journalism-from-al-jazeeras-juliana-ruhfus/">partnered</a>
                with the National Films and Television School to develop <em><a
                        href="https://www.syhacked.com/">#Hacked</a></em> and Altera Studio to create <em><a
                        href="http://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2014/piratefishingdoc/">Pirate Fishing</a></em>.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The power of partnerships</strong></p>
            <p>Even for news organizations with R&amp;D laboratories — which are costly once hardware, space and
                salaries are added up — collaborating with game design or VR production studios remains a viable option
                for certain stories and specific platforms. Working with outside partners can defray costs and
                streamline development while yielding impressive results.</p>

            <p>Last March, for example, <em>The Washington Post</em> published a virtual reality <a
                    href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/mars-journey/">tour of Mars</a> that it built
                with the University of Texas. And <em>The Guardian</em> has teamed up with production studio The Mill to
                create several projects, including “<a
                    href="http://www.themill.com/portfolio/3315/underworld-">Underworld</a>,” a virtual exploration of
                London’s sewer system created for Daydream, and “<a

                    X 9: An Immersive Experience of Solitary Confinement</a>,” shown at the Sundance and Tribeca film
                festivals.</p>
            <p>“We’ve written a lot about solitary confinement and made videos, but this is a very different experience
                of that subject,” <em>The Guardian’s</em> Francesca Panetta, <a

                    with game engine Unity</a>, the VR experience wove audio recordings of inmates who had experienced
                solitary confinement with a claustrophobic virtual simulation of a jail cell created by The Mill.
            </p>
            <p>Many newsrooms, though, still hope to build those kinds of stories in house.</p>
            <p>In November 2015, <em>The New York Times</em> made a statement when it mailed out to its subscribers more
                than a million Google Cardboards, the low-cost viewers through which it is telling video stories in 360
                degrees and stereo sound. Through Google Cardboard and the NYT VR app, the paper has taken its audience
                to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/magazine/man-on-spire.html">top of 1 World Trade
                    Center</a> and to the cratered landscapes of <a

                    Iraq</a>.</p>

            <p>In order to more frequently produce 360 stories, the paper recently added “<a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/the-daily-360">The Daily 360</a>,” which is tasked with creating

                    in Namibia</a>. Production value is low, but so is the barrier to allowing readers a feel for
                wrap-around video.</p>
            <p>Last May, in order to support experimentation with new story formats and platforms, the <em>Times</em> <a
                    href="http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/05/times-rebrands-r-d-studio-promotes-vr-video-at-newfront-004512">relaunched</a>
                NYTLabs, its R&amp;D lab, as Story[X], though it hasn’t said exactly what sort of content it will be
                developing.</p>
            <p>It’s worth noting that the <em>Times’</em> most splashy VR projects, like “<a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/magazine/the-displaced-introduction.html?_r=1">The
                    Displaced</a>” — which debuted with the NYT VR app and relied on the expertise of “immersive artist”
                and VR filmmaker Chris Milk — take months and require vast resources to create. In fact, the paper has
                leaned on VR outfits like <a href="http://ryot.huffingtonpost.com/">RYOT</a>, <a
                    href="http://with.in/">Within</a> and <a href="http://www.konceptvr.com/">Koncept VR</a> to do the
                work it would rather not. As is the case with so many other newsrooms, even though it has an in-house
                laboratory to explore the future of immersive storytelling, readers shouldn’t be surprised if the
                organization relies on outside partners to help it push the boundaries of how we consume the news.</p>
