            <p>Over the past several months here at <em>Immerse, </em>we’ve been poring through articles and broadcasts
                about blockchain technnology, trying to get a handle on how our readers might use it in their work.</p>
            <p>Truthfully, we’re still not sure. But here are a few angles that caught our eye:</p>
            <h3 id="4a44"><em>What the heck is a blockchain anyhow?</em></h3>
            <p>Here’s John Oliver’s gloss on Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain:</p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fg6iDZspbRMg&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dg6iDZspbRMg&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fg6iDZspbRMg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"
                    width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
            <p>Per the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6c707162-ffb1-11e7-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5">Financial
                        Times</a></em>, it’s “an electronic database of transactions, whereby new deals are added to the
                chain and then stamped and protected with a mathematical equation. The database is shared among hundreds
                of other computers, or ‘nodes’ on the network, to make it virtually impossible for one agent to change
                it. These nodes use their computing power and compete to verify and decode the latest transaction. This
                is then appended as a ‘block’ to the chain. Its ability to offer a verifiable, immutable, and public
                record is what attracts many advocates.”</p>
            <h3 id="4e7f"><em>Maybe it’s useful for funding media?</em></h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/?s=blockchain&amp;post_type=post">NiemanLab</a> has been reporting on a
                few different experiments with blockchain and journalism. Chicago-based local news site DNAInfo recently
                <a
                    href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/02/dnainfo-chicago-will-be-reborn-as-block-club-chicago-relying-on-blockchain-and-subscriptions-instead-of-billionaires/">rebranded
                    itself Block Club Chicago</a>, and is soliciting cryptocurrency from subscribers. The transaction is
                based on a cryptocurrency called Civil, which is designed specifically to support journalism startups,
                in what <a
                    href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/10/civil-the-blockchain-based-journalism-marketplace-is-building-its-first-batch-of-publications/">reporter
                    Ricardo Bilton</a> calls “one of the most confusing efforts to fund journalism in recent memory.”
            </p>
            <p>Readers invest in “CVL” tokens, which they give to publications to support journalists. This in turn
                gives newsrooms a speculative stake in the currency, which will “hopefully—increase in value as more
                people buy over time. This, Civil hopes, will encourage more people to invest in the marketplaces,
                creating a self-sustaining system that will help fund more reporting.” What’s more, it provides a
                secured mode for publishing content that is stored in the blockchain. Civil is launching any day now. <a

            <p>“Blockchain may not turn out to be a panacea, but in these dark times for journalism, it offers a glimmer
                of hope,” <a

                David Beard interviews Jarrod Dicker, who left <em>The Washington Post</em> recently to become the CEO
                of blockchain startup Po.et., “an open source ledger that promises to be able to track digital content
                and advertising, matching content with paying audiences.”</p>

                    looking into</a> “initial coin offerings” as a way to fund startups. “Initial coin offerings have
                been so hot — and some say so unhinged — that some companies have found success with them even after
                failed crowdfunding campaigns. An online art gallery known as Maecenas, which failed to raise 400,000
                pounds (currently about $533,000) through crowdfunding this year, raised $15 million a few months later
                through an I.C.O.,” writes <em>New York Times </em>reporter Nathaniel Popper.</p>

                T-Mobile, and Apple, using the Platform to scale existing 2D content into virtual reality, as well as
                creating and distributing original experiences,” reports Alice Bonasio for <a

            <p>For photographers, <a href="https://kodakcoin.com/">KodakCoin</a> proposes to provide greater control
                over managing image rights, and to “seamlessly register, manage, and monetize creative assets for the

            <h3 id="81f4"><em>Could it help us develop more trustworthy content?</em></h3>
            <p>One challenger to Wikipedia proposes to use blockchain technology to both reward contributors and
                authenticate their contributions. This functionality would be built on top of an existing crowdsourced
                encyclopedia called <a href="https://everipedia.org/">Everipedia</a>, which is aiming to attract a more
                diverse group of editors than Wikimedia currently boasts. <em>Wired </em>reporter Peter Rubin <a
                    href="https://www.wired.com/story/everipedia-blockchain/">examines how the system would function

            <p>As a new stream of user-generated data, blockchain technology has the potential to reveal fresh types of
                stories about decentralized human transactions and to power art through data. For example, check out
                this baffling but mesmerizing <em><a href="http://thefwa.com/cases/symphony-of-blockchains">Symphony of
                        Blockchains</a></em><em>.</em></p>
            <h3 id="f870"><em>Dunno, but these “blockchain bros” are scary fascinating</em></h3>
            <p>At the very least, for reporters and documentarians, the blockchain boom is proving to be a font of
                stories that reveal human cupidity and hubris at its finest.</p>
            <p>“Watching the world of <a href="https://www.bna.com/initial-coin-offerings-n73014453179/">initial coin
                    offerings</a> over the past few years has been like watching popcorn pop. Everything rattled around
                in the hot air for what seemed like forever and then pop! Mastercoin! <a

                Tezos! Then other kernels started popping, and now we’re eating popcorn for breakfast, lunch, and
                dinner,” writes Paul Ford for <em><a

            <p><em>“</em>Bubbles are melancholy things — swirls of lies and optimism used to hide a million unrealized
                yearnings,” he continues. “Bitcoin will crash because of course it will. Bubbles burst. The real estate
                and athletics management people go home, and the believers remain, meeting up, planning new markets. It
                could take years, it could take a decade, but the blockchain freaks have a world in their heads, and
                they won’t rest until it’s real. That the rest of us live here, too, is the least of their concerns.
                Some of the things they’ll do will be magical, community-building, economically thrilling. Others may
                keep us up at night.”</p>
