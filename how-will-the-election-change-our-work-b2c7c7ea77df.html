            <h3 id="ab61">How will the election change our work?</h3>
            <p>For many of us, the USA’s 2016 election was a referendum not only on democracy in the U.S., but on the
                role of the media to support or diminish it.</p>
            <p>At <em>Immerse</em>, we care about not just how nonfiction stories are told but why — whose experiences
                they reveal, how they illuminate society, how they move viewers, listeners and participants to
                identification or action.</p>
            <p>Too many of the stories about this election neglected these critical questions, choosing instead to focus
                on the horse race, to present false equivalencies between wildly disparate candidates, or to dwell on
                the statistics of projections that turned out to be entirely false. And now, we keenly feel that the
                First Amendment is under threat.</p>
            <p>We think the media at large can do better. We know that we can do better, be better — using new tools for
                storytelling, reporting, and reflection to bring the urgent issues facing our country and the world to
                life.</p>
            <p>We also know that those same tools and platforms can serve interests inimical to democracy, human rights
                and fair play. Facts can be weaponized. An open platform can be turned into a panopticon. Digital
                methods of organizing are just as available to those who seek to spread hate as those who seek to spread
                love. Sentiment can be twisted to grab eyeballs and sell ads.</p>
            <p>For the nonprofit media community, funding is also a question: what happens when federal dollars for the
                arts and media are redirected, and foundations are compelled to re-route their dollars to direct
                service?</p>
            <p>We are here to converse about it all. Our tagline is “creative discussion of emerging nonfiction
                storytelling,” and we mean it. Let’s talk together about these questions and more.</p>
            <p>Let’s also craft solutions together.</p>
            <p>A persistent question in documentary and journalism is how to seize the possibilities of combining
                various media forms in order to tell compelling stories about issues that matter. In this issue we take
                a close look at the concept of “transmedia” — where has this practice been, where is it going, and what
                is the role of creative movements in supporting new media forms?</p>
            <p>We’re starting off the conversation with two features: a <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/whats-happened-to-transmedia-855f180980e3#.f5tm84hb9">provocation</a>
                from author and maker Andrea Phillips, and a <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/transmedia-what-15edf6b61da">reflection</a> on the term “transmedia” from
                scholar Henry Jenkins. Our respondents include veteran producer <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/transmedia-art-forms-created-in-real-time-4943648389a4">Caitlin
                    Burns</a>, game designer <a href="https://immerse.news/transmedia-85a89e9c19bb#.uf3bl7dlt">Alex
                    Fleetwood</a>, writer/designer/director <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/transmedias-transitions-9c28ef2c5835">Christy Dena</a>, MIT researcher <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/the-trouble-with-nonfiction-transmedia-6a4813bdad16#.n742xnr2m">Sue
                    Ding</a>, producer/professor <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/the-storyteller-the-fixer-866fe492fa49">Ramona Pringle</a>, and
                storyteller and experience designer <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/an-evolution-in-storytelling-and-impact-a90a86f788e5">Lance Weiler</a>.
                We anticipate that others will weigh in on transmedia’s past, present and future over the course of the
                month.</p>
            <p>Our next issue will consider questions of who and how to shape futures through digital and participatory
                media. We believe that creating alternative narratives is central to digging out of the despair and
                paralysis many of us are feeling.</p>
