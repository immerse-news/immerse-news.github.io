            <p><em>By Phoebe Greenberg in collaboration with Andrew Gray</em></p>

            <p><em>As founder and director of PHI — a Montréal-based organization consisting of three separate but
                    complementary entities, the PHI Centre, the PHI Foundation for Contemporary Art and the PHI Studio —
                    I am delighted to introduce our series of articles presented in collaboration with </em>Immerse<em>.
                    Through these articles, we will explore how our approach has been shaped by new modes of art
                    consumption, both online and offline, how we responded, what we’ve learned, and what has
                    fundamentally changed during the global pandemic.</em></p>
            <p>On March 11, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, our doors were open with an
                immersive exhibition at the Centre, while the Foundation was getting ready to unveil its next
                contemporary art exhibition. Also, we had a team operating at the Luxembourg City Film Festival’s
                Virtual Reality Pavilion as curators and producers. We had to close the exhibition and act quickly to
                get everyone back to Montréal before the border shut down. Over the next six months, we endured massive
                change as a cultural institution and as a society, and we’ve had to adjust accordingly. Fortunately,
                PHI’s familiarity with immersive technology and digital art platforms has been instrumental. Our
                strength at PHI is how we operate as an ecosystem — a collaborative triumvirate amalgamating our Studio,
                the Foundation, and the Centre. Dedicated to the exploration of arts and exchange of ideas, we embrace
                the unknown, we experiment, and we take risks. The ethos of our organization gave us tools to adapt, in
                a short period, to both the lockdown and our new reality. On March 13, we closed our doors, but we never
                stopped working.</p>

                    foster transparency and collaboration. (PHI)</span></figure>
            <p>Our instinct was to remain steadfast and dedicated to our core belief that practitioners need to continue
                to be actively engaged in producing, contextualizing, and disseminating art for an audience whether they
                are confined or not. For better or worse, this crisis came at a time when we as a society are capable of
                mediating many aspects of our daily social interactions through technology. From giving artists tools
                and connections while in isolation, to creating exhibitions and events that cater to the transformed
                landscape, in this process PHI has renewed its commitment to finding solutions and reimagining cultural
                exchange.</p>
            <p>We understand the first six months following the announcement of the pandemic in three distinct periods.
                In the beginning, there was an initial shock of confinement and acclimating to public engagement at
                home. Then we adjusted to the political and psychological atmosphere of breaking isolation, leaving our
                homes, and reopening both the PHI Centre and PHI Foundation. And third, in the present, when we see
                ourselves now looking back and envisioning how we continue to move forward. At each step, we framed our
                approach with the mindset that no matter the situation, art plays a vital role in our communal
                existence.</p>
            <p><strong>Keeping Connected, Building Connections</strong></p>
            <p>Sequestered in our homes and confronting confinement, our first project was to continue to bring
                immersive experiences to our audience. We found ways to harness the tools we already had in order to
                keep us connected. Our first project was VR TO GO, a full VR exhibition packed into a single VR headset
                that could be delivered anywhere on the island of Montréal (we have since expanded this service to
                Quebec City). We streamlined the user interface and made the process accessible, intuitive, and
                convenient. We then curated a selection of ten films that highlight the capabilities of VR to offer the
                public immersive storytelling from around the world.</p>

                    GO — the new way of experiencing virtual reality from the comfort of home, available to the public
                    since May 2020. It was born out of a brainstorming session involving the entire organization.
                    (PHI)</span></figure>
            <p>Simultaneously, we designed models to maintain dialogue between artists and their audiences. Confinement
                kept us to our homes, but it also provoked a feeling of solidarity; we weren’t just isolated, we shared
                this experience knowing we were doing it together. We needed to create new systems and maintain
                conversations to foster this sense of connection. It was in this spirit that we launched our virtual
                residency program, <em>Parallel Lines </em>(a subject we will expand on <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/moving-towards-moving-between-786079ad30d2">next week</a> in
                <em>Immerse</em>). This project formed around an inclusive jury with the goal of providing a group of 10
                artists with mentorship, tools, and the means to build intimate connections. We reimagined what a
                virtual artist studio visit might be like. Promoting them from ideation to dissemination, we mobilized
                our platforms to open up their studio to the public and to share their vision, practice, process.
            </p>
            <p>Giving the public a window into their practice also gave us a glimpse into how artists were also
                adapting. For many, this process was the framework to rethink their own practice for a digital
                environment. For the cellist and composer Justin Wright, isolation gave him the time to invest in
                learning more than creating. The multidisciplinary artist Naghmeh Shafiri found he was more motivated to
                be direct and open relating to others. Philippe Dubost was drawn towards how the universal experience of
                a piece imagined for the web differs from an installation in a physical gallery. All of these
                transformations were happening in real-time with their audiences right there with them, and it revealed
                an intimate portrait of the artistic process as they documented each step.</p>

            <p>While the pandemic continued to spread, we established new modes of communication. <em>PHI Virtual
                </em>was a result of our sustained commitment to adapting immersive technology to create sites for
                meaningful conversations between art practitioners globally. We created a digital landmark, taking cues
                from the PHI Centre itself and reimagining what it could resemble in the virtual world. Using a
                prototype, participants could put on their avatars and be transported to roundtable discussions. This
                free forum would be a backdrop for the exchanges we were having about how we could reconfigure our
                tools, and how our relationship to spaces would change.</p>

            <p><strong>Opening Our Doors</strong></p>
            <p>In May, as restrictions were lifted, we all returned to the gallery with a shifted focus. The landscape
                had changed, and we had to transform how we thought of the Centre as an exhibition space. We began to
                think of it more as a safe destination for visitors to reconnect with art.</p>
            <p>Inspired by neighborhood outdoor concerts, <em>Sonication</em> (the term meaning to use sound frequencies
                to agitate particles in plant matter) took root organically. We transformed our rooftop into a stage and
                studio for hybrid concerts that were not only broadcast throughout the building but also heard through
                the neighborhood and online. They offered us an opportunity to support the local music scene. We want
                people who come to feel as though they are backstage at a concert and for people in the streets
                listening to feel that they are a part of something. We want to bring high production musical concerts
                into the homes of people who want to share these experiences but can’t be physically present.</p>

            <p>Starting from a blank slate, we organized our first exhibition, <em>Emergence &amp; Convergence
                </em>(extended to October 25, 2020) to welcome back the public and encourage them to explore their
                connection to the ecological and technological world. The hope was to invite them to a space that
                highlighted the ways in which immersive art can provoke a contemplative state of mind, taking
                navigational cues from nature.</p>
            <p>The centerpiece of the exhibition is Montréal artist George Fok’s multi-projection piece, <em>Seeking
                    Stillness</em>. Originally conceived in 2017, the audiovisual installation was revised as an
                immersive and contemplative experience placing the individual at the center of a giant art piece,
                bringing a younger audience that came to create unexpected content for social media platforms,
                especially TikTok. <em>Seeking Stillness</em> is a perfectly suited backdrop to this post-confinement
                collective phenomena. With almost 100k views of video content created and shared, George’s piece
                accommodates a large number of individuals playfully sharing an experience.</p>

            <p>Continuing to explore new configurations of time and distance, we also introduced our new lab project,
                the <em>PHI_portal</em>, in collaboration with Shared_Studios. The public immersive art installation
                invites curators from around the world into a personal one-on-one exchange with full-body engagement. A
                third space between two physical locations, they touch on important contemporary issues. The
                <em>PHI_portal</em> is a means to dissolve the barriers between locations and provide a safe, inclusive,
                way for participants to share testimonies and knowledge. With political unrest, continuing uncertainty
                of the pandemic and closed borders, we acknowledge the need for these kinds of intimate and socially
                relevant dialogues.
            </p>
            <p>The Foundation reopened with <em>RELATIONS: Diaspora and Painting, </em>a show highlighting paintings
                focusing on the theme of diaspora in resonance with the current political landscape. Mobilized quickly
                to continue its commitment to making art a part of everyday life, the Foundation integrated online
                activities ranging from creative workshops to one-on-one interviews, panel discussions, and collective
                reading groups.</p>
            <p><strong>New Realities</strong></p>
            <p>As the discourse around the pandemic changes and our behavior adapts to our new reality, we realize that
                things won’t be the same going forward. The conversation now is not the same today as it was in March
                when we shut our doors to the public and went into confinement.</p>
            <p>Immersive technology plays a pivotal role in artists and art institutions’ capacity to create meaningful
                connections in an era where physical distances and intimacy are mediated by technology. Our focus is on
                maintaining constant engagement with the public, the support of local artists, and seeking out the most
                relevant work that inspires our communities. In our exploration of virtual and physical storytelling, we
                remain committed to finding accessible and inclusive opportunities for artistic expression and
                dissemination.</p>
            <p>Our approach is anything but traditional. We are rethinking our work environment and continuing to adapt
                our digital and physical spaces to reimagine them as a destination. As we look towards the future, we
                consider the need to produce a virtual museum as a companion to our physical spaces. The transformation
