            <p>Jessica Brillhart thinks deeply about immersive media and she knows what she’s talking about, because she
                experiments with everything she writes and talks about in her story-making practice. She has her own
                immersive studio, <a href="https://www.vrai.pictures/">Vrai Pictures</a>; has made beautiful VR projects
                such as <em><a href="https://www.vrai.pictures/b5vr-2/">Beethoven’s Fifth</a></em><em>,</em> and has
                just released a new spatial audio platform called <a href="https://www.traverse.fm/">Traverse</a>.
                Previously at Google, she helped develop Google Jump. Her <a
                    href="https://medium.com/the-language-of-vr/tagged/editing">Medium series</a> on the language of VR
                was hugely influential for those of us trying to figure out how to tell stories in this emerging medium.
                Jessica has traveled to South Africa twice to work with me in my Electric South capacity, providing
                excellent mentorship and support to African VR creators. She’s giving the <a
                    href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2019/events/PP101273">Convergence Keynote</a> at SXSW so if you’re
                headed to Austin look out for her there!</p>

            <p>Founded in 1991 and led by artists Matt Adams, Ju Row Farr, and Nick Tandavanitj, Blast Theory creates
                interactive and immersive experiences centered on audiences. Their work takes place in virtual and
                physical spaces— from pubs, canals, and abandoned warehouses to libraries, museums and apps. In
                <em>O</em><em><a href="https://www.blasttheory.co.uk/projects/operation-black-antler/">peration Black
                        Antler</a></em> you enter the murky world of undercover surveillance, where you must meet, get
                to know, and ultimately try to win the trust of someone whose political and moral views may be the polar
                opposite of your own. In <em><a
                        href="https://www.blasttheory.co.uk/projects/karen/">Karen</a></em><em>,</em> you interact with
                a life coach via an app, an experience that gets decidedly weirder the longer you do it. One project,
                aptly named <em><a href="https://www.blasttheory.co.uk/projects/kidnap/">Kidnap</a></em>, involves
                kidnapping people:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Entrants paid £10 to enter a lottery in the hope of being kidnapped. Ten finalists were chosen at
                    random and put under surveillance. Two winners — Debra Burgess, a 27-year-old Australian working as
                    a temp, and Russell Ward, a 19-year old from Southend working in a 24-hour convenience store — were
                    snatched in broad daylight and taken to a secret location for 48 hours. The process was broadcast
                    live onto the internet. Online visitors were able to control the video camera inside the safe house
                    and communicate live with the kidnappers.</p>

            <p>Sarah Ellis is Director of Digital Development at the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). Under her
                excellent leadership the RSC is part of the <a

                    of the Future</a> government initiative, exploring “the possibilities of virtual reality (VR),
                augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and the opportunities of real-time immersive performance
                that are connected across multiple platforms, creating opportunities for the UK cultural sector to
                change the way audiences experience live performance by making it more immersive.” Sarah is one of those
                people who brings Magic Leap and Shakespeare together, and it all just kinda makes sense. She’s also a
                very inspiring public speaker.</p>

            <p>Kent Bye is host of the <em><a href="http://voicesofvr.com/">Voices of VR</a></em><em> </em>podcast, a
                really thoughtful podcast series that goes beyond the cycles of hype and despair that often surround the
                medium. You’ll often see him at VR events armed with his microphone. He has conducted over 1,000
                interviews since 2014 and has branched off into new podcasts, including <em>Voices of AI.</em> We often
                worry that we are not creating an adequate history of the present when it comes to these evolving
                mediums, so these audio conversations are a real gift, a documentation of things we may soon forget as
                we reach for the next shiny storytelling object.</p>

                    talk</a> on algorithmic bias has been viewed over a million times. She somehow also manages to find
                time to work on her PhD at MIT. She wrote an <a

                    piece</a> for <em>The New York Times</em> about what happens when robots don’t see dark skin in
                facial recognition:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Everyday people should support lawmakers, activists, and public-interest technologists in demanding
                    transparency, equity, and accountability in the use of artificial intelligence that governs our
                    lives. Facial recognition is increasingly penetrating our lives, but there is still time to prevent
                    it from worsening social inequalities. To do that, we must face the coded gaze.</p>
