            <p>In the days after the March release of Japanese developer FromSoftware’s massively anticipated open-world
                action role-playing game <em>Elden Ring</em> (2022),<em> </em>I saw innumerable users, friends and
                strangers alike, <a href="https://twitter.com/NoxDMartinez/status/1515896895645827077">announce</a> on
                Twitter that they were beginning to <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/alecrobbins/status/1515877732273455104">play the game</a> by <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/pogform/status/1499544158708584453">posting pictures</a> of their bespoke
                avatars. In the months since, I’ve continued to see people put up pics of “themselves” to update their
                in-game progress, whether posting <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/thelicoricekid/status/1501959357197692938">where they’ve made it to</a> or
                <a href="https://twitter.com/dais196_/status/1516100383751483402">illustrating how they’ve evolved</a>
                and leveled up. Posting pics of oneself in the game is also a key component of gaming communities on
                Reddit — for <em>Elden Ring</em>, a search for “my character” results in a large <a
                    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/search/?q=my%20character&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sr_nsfw=">variety
                    of posts</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Fans of FromSoft’s games, which also include <em>Bloodborne </em>(2015) and the acclaimed <em>Dark
                    Souls</em> (2009) series, have formed a tight-knit online community that heavily includes
                representations of their avatars, the products of character creation engines that have become
                increasingly detailed and complex with each game installment. In parallel to these trends, character
                customization screens have evolved to allow for greater flexibility in letting a player devise their
                in-game gender, race, style, and facial characteristics, all to express whatever desires they have for
                their game presence, whether that’s to imitate their real-world look or conjure an imaginary one. Such
                features have become so detailed as to constitute more than one box on the checklist of things one must
                do to play a game; they’re now a distinct aspect of the gameplay experience—a vital, vivid part of game
                creativity and community-building.</p>
            <p>Avatars in video games <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/a-chance-to-be-good-the-once-future-avatar-b330d812c412">began</a> with a
                straightforwardly utilitarian function: an easy mode of identification. Rules and the logic of the game
                world unfold around the avatar. <em>You are Mario, and now you’ll learn to jump. You’re Pac-Man, and you
                    must eat the dots.</em> Over time, as interactive design has evolved, we’ve come to recognize the
                political and thematic implications of how avatars are implemented. More than that, we can see now how
                avatars can also be artistic works themselves, and how creating them can be meaningful acts for players.
            </p>
            <p>Even if one does not put much thought into picking or designing their avatar, their choice can be
                revealing. I use a Mii character that looks vaguely like myself for my account on my Nintendo Switch. On
                the same Switch, my brother uses a stock avatar of Mario’s archenemy Bowser. My ex-girlfriend used a
                cute alpaca character from the <em>Animal Crossing </em>series that suited her own taste. Avatars can
                even become points of humorous comparison between games and other media; I’ve seen people on Twitter
                note how their <em>Elden Ring </em>characters resemble <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/dyeingburner/status/1516107430014369792">wrestlers</a> or <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/marisa_desu/status/1515980740697145356">manga characters</a>.</p>

            <h3 id="0a22">What Role Are You Playing?</h3>
            <p>Curious about how seriously people do or don’t take the character creation process, I ran an informal
                poll by several good friends who are all avid gamers, asking them some basic questions about how they
                use these features in various games. One question that especially interested me was how much they did or
                didn’t identify with their avatars. <em>Elden Ring, </em>for example,<em> </em>is classified as a
                role-playing game, but broadly speaking, in nearly all games, users play a role of some sort. The
                difference is whether the role is one the game provides wholly for you or if you have more of a say in
                what it looks and sounds like, including elements of a backstory.</p>
            <p>My respondents were split on the question of whether they considered a user-designed game avatar as being
                “them” or a separate character. Kambole said, “It’s dependent on the game, but normally, it’s
                role-playing as a separate character. For example, <em>Destiny 2</em> has character races with different
                histories, and I like to imagine what reactions they might inspire as I play. Same with something like
                <em>Elden Ring.</em>” Cole said something similar: “I think of my avatar as a separate character in
                almost every game I play. I only ever make a character look like me if it’s a life-sim-style game, like
                <em>Sims</em> or <em>Animal Crossing</em>, or if I’m making a system-based avatar like a Mii.” In
                contrast, Esther opined, “Sometimes it’s fun to role-play, but it’s rare that a game really gives the
                player space to do that, so it’s usually more fun for me to take things at a remove and make choices
                based on my own instincts.”
            </p>
            <h3 id="a536">Limitations Despite Greater Customizability</h3>
            <p>Both Kambole and Esther observed how, despite the intricate number of options character creators have
                these days (some games, like <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/conan-exiles-dick-slider/">Conan
                        Exiles</a></em><em> </em>or <em><a
                        href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077s-genital-customization-options-leave-a-l-1845863407">Cyberpunk
                        2077</a></em>, even allow one to modify their avatar’s genitals), there were still gaps in
                <em>Elden Ring</em>’s system. (This speaks to a broader issue with game character creation systems, <a
                    href="https://kotaku.com/the-natural-the-trouble-portraying-blackness-in-video-1736504384">particularly
                    as they pertain to representations of nonwhite people</a>.) Esther found, “Games almost never have
                hair options that look like mine (very curly, shoulder-length).” Similarly, Kambole noted, “I don’t care
                about an avatar being a digital facsimile of me because, more often than not, the facilities to do so —
                mainly with Afro hair — are lacking.”
            </p>
            <p>Avatar creation also allows for flexible expressions of gender. Esther, a trans woman, said that “Games
                were important in getting me to initially question my gender identity. I have vivid memories of playing
                the <em>Mass Effect</em> games and <em>Skyrim</em> for the first time, selecting female characters in
                both, and wondering why I gravitated toward that choice without even thinking about it. It helped a lot
                by letting me ‘present’ as a woman in a completely locked-off and safe environment, and they were pretty
                instrumental in me realizing that I wanted to transition.” Cole, who is nonbinary, says, “I play as
                girls more than I used to. I’ve grown increasingly interested in femme presentation. Playing as female
                avatars allows for some fun self-identification.”</p>
            <p>Players also differ in how much time they invest in these features. Esther said, “I understand the appeal
                of getting into the nitty-gritty, fussing with sliders that change nose shape or eyelid size, but most
                of the time I just want to get into the actual game. I can never make the character look exactly how I
                want even when I try, so I’d rather just slightly alter one of the default faces and get on with it.”
                Kambole concurred: “The broader strokes are what matter for me. That said, I do like playing around with
                cosmetic options, like tattoos and scars.” But Cole differed: “I usually spend 30-45 minutes if the
                character creator is super in-depth. I don’t care too much about minute precision, but I do like playing
                around with sliders a lot to see what happens.”</p>
            <h3 id="299e">Avatar-Sharing as Creative Canvas</h3>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F_1jGnFt78H8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_1jGnFt78H8&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F_1jGnFt78H8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"
                    width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
            <p>Cole gets at one crucial element of avatar-sharing culture: messing around. In the case of <em>Elden
                    Ring, </em>whether you’re creating an appealingly <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/TheGayChingy/status/1512542484039041029">animesque adventurer</a> or
                trying to <a
                    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/tauybt/tried_to_make_zuko_from_avatar_the_last_airbender/">approximate</a>
                an extant <a
                    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/sb1n1i/female_shepard_has_so_much_better_voice_acting/">pop
                    culture figure</a>, the more out-there results exemplify the creative possibilities of these
                features. And nothing showcases this better than the long-running YouTube series <em><a
                        href="https://www.themcelroy.family/monsterfactory">Monster Factory</a></em><em>, </em>in which
                hosts Justin and Griffin McElroy have fun pushing character customization options far past their
                intended parameters. They’ve set <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1jGnFt78H8">a parody of a
                    post-nuclear-apocalypse housewife</a> upon the wasteland of <em>Fallout 4, </em><a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYnldxUpYQQ">terrorized the most self-serious users</a> of
                <em>Second Life, </em>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csPaadPE04w">found some truly
                    remarkable inadvertently sexual features</a> in <em>SoulCalibur VI</em>. They embody the spirit of
                every mischievous teenager who realized that nothing was stopping them from making their avatar’s head
                comically large — before playing the game as normal.
            </p>
            <p>It feels like we’ve only begun to tap game character-building features’ potential for creativity and
                entertainment. Imagine an artist taking the <em>Monster Factory</em> ethos even further, using these
                elements like a sculptor, crafting nonhuman entities no one designing these games would have ever
                thought possible. As character creation engines become even more robust, inclusive, and imaginative, the
                potential for customization will only expand.</p>
