            <h3 id="fa23">An <a href="https://immerse.news/your-future-needs-you-671fb7a44a6a">Immerse Response</a></h3>
            <p>These past two years, I have been working on a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CartaAbertaDoc/">feature
                    film</a> and interactive documentary about Brazilian students fighting for better public education.
                I have been filming and watching more than a hundred hours of archival footage of the marches of 2015
                and 2016 there. This gives me a particular perspective on <em>RIOT</em>, the responsive media project
                that creator <a href="https://immerse.news/your-future-needs-you-671fb7a44a6a">Karen Palmer wrote
                    about</a> recently in <em>Immerse.</em></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/caio.castor">Caio Castor</a>, a São Paulo filmmaker who has shot the
                most relevant social topics in recent years, gave me a hard disk with sixty hours of his footage of
                students’ protests. I see in this footage that when police attack students, Caio goes near the
                aggressions to record evidence of injustice. Caio is a white man, protected by a camera, and is able to
                maintain a very calm voice even in the worst situations. In one of segment of footage, he politely asks
                the police why officers are arresting a young student. The policemen do not answer him, and, after few
                minutes, Caio is also arrested. After another protest, police destroyed all of his equipment, including
                his memory card, when he filmed their beating of a teenager. In general, people beaten by police in
                Caio’s footage are black.</p>
            <p>Sitting at my desktop, I watched those scenes recorded by Caio of bombs, truncheons, and disproportionate
                violence against teenagers. Many times I felt tachycardia, so I stopped, drank some water, and stretched
                before continuing to edit. This happened every day for the past year. Of course, watching from home was
                much easier than actually being there. When I am the one recording the protests and I see police
                violence against the kids, I can’t keep the calm voice of Caio, and I get really, really angry. Why can
                our governors order this level of violence against the public? Why do those police officers accept
                orders from their superiors and attack those kids fighting for a better world? That world would be
                better also for those police and their kids, who probably also study in under-resourced public schools.
                How can we, as a society, accept this? How should we organize ourselves and react?</p>
            <p>When editing my footage, I can listen to my own voice arguing with the police. Maybe because I am a white
                woman with a fancy camera, I have never been arrested. Maybe because I am not shooting every protest and
                recording so much evidence against police, as Caio is, I have only been threatened by police.</p>
            <p>I was in the process of editing my film and watching those scenes from when I had the luck of meeting
                Palmer, “The Storyteller from the Future,” and participating in her film and game. Palmer explains that
                <em>RIOT</em> is an emotionally responsive film which uses facial recognition and artificial
                intelligence technology to enable players to navigate through a dangerous riot. The user is confronted
                by a cop: Respond with fear and the film goes in one direction. Respond with anger and it goes in
                another. Her goal is to enable participants to become aware of their subconscious behaviour, and enable
                them to consciously build new neurological pathways in their brains. I loved the idea, and thought it
                could be really useful.
            </p>
            <p>When I experienced <em>RIOT,</em> I felt it as a very quiet counterpoint to the reality. In the first
                sensor decision, for example, a police officer approaches a protestor. I am used to shooting and
                watching, which is why the facial sensors recognized my attitude as calm. In the game, I did not argue
                with the officer as I did in real protests, so I did not deserve to be beaten. I was able to go until
                the end, and <em>RIOT</em> said I was prepared to go to a real riot.</p>
            <p>Palmer’s interactive film suggests that whether or not police attack you depends on whether you are calm,
                angry, or fearful. This setup means responsibility for the police violence rests upon the victim, and
                does not consider other factors such as racism, classism, and the desire of the state — the “boss” of
                those police — to destroy any mass movement that can change the status quo and the inequality and
                injustices of the state. It also fails to consider that repression in the real world can be much crueler
                than a single police officer approaching you.</p>
            <p>The <em>RIOT</em> experience reminds me that the desire to use innovative technology in our works,
                specifically when addressing social issues, should not obfuscate the real and important
                questions—questions that encourage the audience to understand why these events are happening in the
                first place, or what has happened in the past that made the present as it is, or what we can do to make
                a different future.</p>
            <p>In Brazil, almost <a
                    href="https://g1.globo.com/monitor-da-violencia/noticia/cresce-numero-de-pessoas-mortas-pela-policia-no-brasil-assassinatos-de-policiais-caem.ghtml">fourteen
                    people are killed by police each day</a>, and this number is increasing. Our military police is an
                inheritance from military dictatorship that ended in the ’80s. Probably that’s why freedom of protest is
                still not very welcome in our democracy. In 2013, police assaulted <a
                    href="https://amp-mg.jusbrasil.com.br/noticias/112022114/abraji-registra-102-casos-de-agressao-a-jornalistas-durante-cobertura-das-manifestacoes">seventy-seven
                    journalists</a> in marches. Their crime? Reporting on protests. Between 2015 and 2016, there were <a
                    href="https://ponte.org/violencia-policial-e-detencoes-arbitrarias-viraram-regras-em-manifestacoes/">1,244
                    arbitrary arrests</a> of protestors, and this is not unique to Brazil. In Turkey, for example, <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/world/europe/turkey-riots.html">more than three hundred
                    people were injured and at least 1,750 detained</a> in the clashes that started with <a
                    href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/01/world/europe/police-attack-protesters-in-istanbuls-taksim-square.html?pagewanted=all">demonstrators
                    opposing the razing of an Istanbul park</a> in 2013. During three months of protest in Venezuela in
                2017, there were 3,300 arbitrary arrests and <a
                    href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2017/07/10/actualidad/1499703639_547419.html">ninety-one
                    deaths</a>. In Iran <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/09/iran-protests-deaths-custody-human-rights">more
                    than a thousand people were arrested</a> in protests during January this year and at least
                twenty-one people died after violent clashes between protesters and security guards.</p>
            <p>I am sure that there were varied motivations for the protestors and for the police in these different
                countries. But I doubt that the cause of the violence had to do with whether the protestors were calm or
                angry.</p>
