            <p>It’s a first for the Studio — and the Open Doc Lab as a whole — to host a Mozilla Fellow as part of
                Mozilla’s <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/fellowships/">global efforts</a> to improve
                internet health. The 2019–2020 fellowship program supports 25 global fellows, including artists,
                technologists, lawyers, activists, and scientists, many hosted at international organizations dedicated
                to democracy, accountability, and models in technology that help rather than harm.</p>
            <p>During her time at the Co-Creation Studio, Winger-Bearskin will develop a new project,
                <em>Wampum.code</em>, that brings greater accountability to tech with a new model for values-based
                dependencies in software projects. Her model is founded in Indigenous values and practices, specifically
                Hodenoshounee, or Iroquois, a confederacy of six Indigenous nations. (Winger-Bearskin previously <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/decentralized-storytelling-d8450490b3ee">wrote on this topic for
                </a><em><a href="https://immerse.news/decentralized-storytelling-d8450490b3ee">Immerse</a></em>.)
            </p>
            <p>“Stories are the oldest technology we have as humans,” said Winger-Bearskin. “They help us to encode our
                values, technologies, teachings, survival strategies into various media. In Hodenoshounee culture,
                storytelling is a means of encoding the social values of the community. We believe contributions to the
                community should be made to last for seven generations. In my culture, ethics, technology, and
                storytelling are fused in a way that might seem foreign to the Western perspective. My goal in this
                project is to ask how my tribe’s way of sharing information could be applied to make software projects
                more ethically robust. The ethics in storytelling are pretty much the same as ethics we need for
                software development. The heart of the matter is: how to make explicit the values we are encoding into
                software?”</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/624/318/0*JFarae0W51wiLqpC" width="624"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="16825480829781816296">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="16825480829781816296"><span class="marginnote"><em>The Iroquoian Wampum belt, a
                        key inspiration for American democracy, had encoded principles of democracy of the Iroquois
                        Confederacy directly in the beading. With Wampum.code, Amelia Winger-Bearskin suggests that like
                        the wampum, our contemporary systems of computer coding have embedded our social values directly
                        in them. Rather than just “correcting for bias” in the algorithms, we need to rewrite and rewire
                        the code, on ethical principles.</em></span></figure>
            <p>To develop the project, Winger-Bearskin will co-create with her community as well as other Indigenous
                Nations to shape the concept through workshops, and partnerships.</p>
            <p>“There has never been a greater urgency to rewire and rebuild our technology systems from the code on
                up,” said Katerina Cizek, of Co-Creation Studio at MIT Open Documentary Lab. “We know that the answers
                to the world’s biggest emergencies, all profoundly interconnected with our current technologies — the
                Climate Crisis, the collapse of democracies, the global economic, and racial injustices — need to be
                aligned and driven with Indigenous-centred approaches. That’s why we are honoured to welcome Amelia
                Winger-Bearskin to bring her artistry, wisdom, experience, and energy to the studio and lab, with her
                remarkable project <em>Wampum.code</em>.”</p>
            <p>Winger-Bearskin will also draw on her interdisciplinary experiences as a nonprofit founder and Executive
                Director of <a href="https://medium.com/idea-new-rochelle">IDEA New Rochelle</a>, professor, creative
                advisor to <a href="http://www.sundance.org/programs/new-frontier">Sundance New Frontiers Lab</a>, as
                well as her artistic endeavors, including <a href="http://studioamelia.com">VR/AR/XR and Video art</a>
                permanently housed at Guggenheim Museum and the McCord Museum.</p>
            <p>“The caliber of fellows across the Mozilla program is world-class, and we are privileged to welcome
                Amelia Winger-Bearskin to the studio, lab, and greater MIT community,” said William Uricchio, Principal
                Investigator of the Co-Creation Studio, MIT Open Doc Lab.</p>
            <p>In addition to her own project, Winger-Bearskin will also contribute to the development of the
                studio.<em> </em>Her work embodies the many dimensions of co-creation: working within community, across
                disciplines, and with algorithms.</p>
            <p>“Amelia Winger-Bearskin’s Wampum.code project is exactly the kind of work that we want to support in the
                studio and lab. It’s looking to indigenous storytelling practices to offer new models for technology
                development that are ethical and based on community values” said Sarah Wolozin, Director of Open
                Documentary Lab, and Co-PI of the Studio. “We welcome her into our community and look forward to
                supporting her work.”</p>
            <p>Winger-Bearskin will also participate as an Open Documentary Lab fellow, joining the current cohort of 15
                fellows who develop their projects in residency at MIT.</p>
            <p>The Mozilla fellowships begin October 1, 2019, kicking off with the first gathering of the fellows and
                host organizations at Mozfest in London England later in the month. Winger-Bearskin will bring
                workshops, lectures, and mentorship to the MIT community throughout her tenure as fellow until June
                2020.</p>
