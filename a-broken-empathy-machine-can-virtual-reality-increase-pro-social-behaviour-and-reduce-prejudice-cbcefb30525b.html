            <p><em>by Dr. Harry Farmer</em></p>
            <p>The past five years have seen an explosion in both the technical capability and the affordability of
                virtual reality (VR) headsets which has enabled VR to spread outside of the lab into consumer
                environments. This progress has been accompanied by an increased interest in the use of VR as a means of
                conveying narrative including nonfiction narratives. For the past two years the<a
                    href="https://immerse.news/virtual-realities-immersive-documentary-encounters-51b1b5d5b73"> Virtual
                    Realities: Immersive Documentary Encounters</a> project has been examining the production process
                for, and audience reactions to, this new field of virtual reality nonfiction (VRNF). <a
                    href="http://vrdocumentaryencounters.co.uk/vrmediography/">Research by our team</a> has found that
                between 2014 and 2017 the amount of virtual reality nonfiction content being released increased from 10
                to 181 pieces and this increase in content seems set to continue with VRNF now an established feature of
                many film and documentary festivals.</p>
            <p>A significant influence on the development of VRNF can be summed up by Here be Dragons/Within CEO Chris
                Milk’s description of VR as “the ultimate empathy machine” in his 2015 TED talk. This idea suggests that
                by giving us a sense of presence, the feeling of being spatially transported to the middle of a scene,
                VR can induce in the viewer a greater sense of identification with, and empathy for, the people being
                observed than traditional formats. The term empathy is commonly used but often vaguely defined. Within
                cognitive science it is commonly defined as the ability to share and understand the experiences of
                others. However, in common usage the term is often expanded to include related concepts such as sympathy
                and compassion and seen as the cause behind positive social behaviours and decreased stereotyping and
                discrimination towards marginalised groups. The idea that VR could provide a powerful new medium for
                boosting empathy and pro-social behaviours was a common theme among many early adopters of VR in
                nonfiction.</p>
            <p>It is worth noting that the idea that novel technology and art can be used to drive changes in social
                attitudes is not a new one. Literature has long been held up as a powerful means of putting ourselves in
                another’s shoes. Indeed, thinkers such as Stephen Pinker and Lynn Hunt have linked the rise of the
                popular novel in the late 18th century to an increased acceptance of the ideas of basic human rights.
                For example, novels like <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> and autobiographical accounts of the experiences of
                enslaved Africans such as those of Olaudah Equiano and Fredrick Douglass have been credited with playing
                an important role in the growth of the abolitionist movements in Britain and the United States.</p>
            <p>Similar claims have also been made of traditional 2D films. The phrase “empathy machine” was first used
                by the film critic Roger Ebert to describe the power of cinema to allow the viewer to “understand a
                little bit more about what it’s like to be a different gender, a different race, a different age, a
                different economic class, a different nationality, a different profession, different hopes, aspirations,
                dreams and fears.” These examples situate claims about VR’s ability change our social attitudes as
                continuing a well-trodden path regarding the role of art and media in granting us insight into the lives
                of others.</p>
            <p>However, the value of nonfiction VR as a means of producing empathy has been criticised on a number of
                grounds. One objection raised by Kate Nash critiques the idea of VRNF as an empathy machine by claiming
                that the concept promotes an “improper distance” between subject and viewer. In her 2018 paper Nash
                argues that VRNF can only ever offer a superficial, imagined encounter with another person. She further
                argues that, in suggesting that such encounters can offer a deep understanding into the experiences of
                others, VRNF creators risk trivialising the suffering of others while fetishising our own responses to
                that suffering.</p>
            <p>Others, like the social psychologist Paul Bloom, have questioned whether focusing on empathy is a
                desirable goal in the first place. Bloom argues that viewing empathy as the foundation of moral
                interactions leaves our behaviour prey to a host of cognitive distortions. For example, we tend to feel
                more empathy towards specific individuals rather than larger groups and to those whose behaviour we view
                as deserving, as opposed to those who violate our social norms, e.g. being more empathetic to those who
                contract HIV due to a blood transfusion compared to those who contract it due to heroin use. If Bloom’s
                analysis is correct, it is possible that, while VRNF may boost empathy towards the specific individuals
                depicted, this boost will not necessarily transfer into more compassionate behaviour towards the larger
                groups to which they belong.</p>
            <p>Along with these theoretical issues there are also practical issues with examining the power of VRNF to
                boost empathy. One particularly strong one is the lack of any agreed way to measure empathy using an
                implicit task. Instead, researchers have tended to use self-report measures which are open to what
                psychologists term “demand characteristics,” or the desire to respond in the way they believe the
                experimenters want them to rather than reporting what they actually feel.</p>
            <p>Motivated by these issues with the “pure” measurement of empathy, we decided to focus instead on the
                question of how far VR could affect wider social attitudes and behaviour. Specifically, we sought to
                examine how exposure to the VRNF piece “Clouds Over Sidra,” directed by Chris Milk, which depicts the
                life of Sidra a 13-year-old Syrian girl living in the Za’atari refugee camp in Jordan, affected
                prejudice towards Arab people. The question of whether VR can reduce prejudice is particularly important
                give the rise in Islamophobic and anti-Arab sentiment that exists in Western society. This has been most
                graphically illustrated by far-right attacks such the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand and, in the
                UK, the attack on worshippers at the Finsbury Park mosque in London, but also in the rise of
                anti-immigrant parties and rhetoric across the West in the wake of the decades long “War on Terror” and
                the more recent Mediterranean migrant crisis. In this context VRNF could potentially be a useful tool in
                challenging such negative prejudices and attitudes.</p>

            <h3 id="6973"><strong>Our Research</strong></h3>
            <p>To examine these issues, our team conducted a lab study in which we modulated two affordances of 360°
                VRNF, immersion and agency. By immersion we mean the extent to which the viewer is fully immersed in the
                visual scene. <em>High</em> immersion occurs in situations where the scene fills the viewer’s entire
                visual field, such as when wearing a head-mounted display, in our case an Oculus Rift headset,
                <em>Low</em> immersion refers to viewing the scene on a more traditional flat-screen device, in our case
                a Samsung Tablet. By agency we referred to the extent to which the viewer had control of where in the
                scene they could look. Thus, for us, high agency would be the original 360° video format, while low
                agency was a “director’s cut” of the video with a fixed view in each scene.

                    in our full virtual reality condition.</span></figure>
            <p>The combination of these two affordances of VR produced four different viewing conditions: high immersion
                and high agency, in which people watched in a headset and controlled their viewpoint via head movements
                (a “full” VR experience); high immersion and low agency in which viewers used the headset but their view
                was fixed and did not change with their head movements; low immersion and high agency, in which people
                viewed the documentary using a Samsung tablet with a custom-built “magic window” app which changed the
                scene based how they moved and tilted the tablet in space; and, finally, low immersion and low agency,
                where people watched the documentary on the tablet with a fixed view in a similar manner to a
                traditional, non-VR film. We tested 32 participants in each of these conditions, giving us a total
                sample of 132 participants.</p>
            <p>We assessed the effects of watching the documentary in different conditions on prejudice using two
                different measures. The first was an explicit questionnaire measuring subtle prejudice towards Arabs and
                Muslims more generally. Importantly, we also measured implicit attitudes towards Arabs using a novel
                version of the implicit association test (IAT). This test is designed to reveal people’s unconscious
                associations between concepts in different categories by comparing how rapidly they can categorise these
                concepts when paired (for a demo, visit the <a
                    href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/featuredtask.html">Project IMPLICIT website</a>). In our
                version of the IAT, we had participants (all of whom identified as having a European background)
                categorise photos of Arab and Wfaces and positive and negative words. If people responded faster when
                they had to press the same button for White faces and positive words and the other button for Arab faces
                and negative words we classified them has having a preference for white? Europeans. In contrast, we
                classified people as having a preference for Arabs if they responded faster when they had to press the
                same button for Arab faces and positive words and the other button for European faces and negative
                words.</p>
            <p>Our final set of measures sought to investigate whether any change in empathy or prejudice caused by our
                VR intervention also led to meaningful changes in behaviour. To measure this, we gave our participants
                information about a charity run by Syrian refugees and gave them the option to donate any amount from
                £0-£10 of their payment from the study towards the charity. To further test their commitment to the
                charity we also asked participants if they wished to subscribe to the charities email address, an action
                which had a potential cost in terms of receiving emails from the charity in the future.</p>
            <p>To look at the effect of VR on implicit and explicit prejudice we analysed differences in our measures
                between the four groups at two measurement points (pre- and post-viewing) as the key factors. For the
                self-report measure our data showed that there were no significant differences between our four groups,
                and reported levels of subtle prejudice did not change over time, suggesting that viewing the
                documentary in any format had no effect on participant’s’ self-reported levels of prejudice. When
                examining the results of the IAT measure we found a main effect of time with participants showing a
                lower score (less bias against Arabs) after watching the documentary compared to their pre-test scores.
                However, this pattern was the same across all four conditions, suggesting that the manner in which the
                documentary was watched was not important for the amount of prejudice change reports.</p>

            <p>Finally, we examined the extent to which viewing conditions affected pro-social behaviour as measured by
                donations to a charity for Syrian refugees and tendency to subscribe to the charity’s newsletter. For
                both these measures, however, the results were similar to those for prejudice. While our participants
                did tend to donate money to the charity — with an average donation rate of £4 — the amount donated did
                not significantly differ between our conditions, nor did the rate of newsletter subscriptions, which was
                approximately 30% in all four conditions.</p>

            <h3 id="3e98"><strong>Implications and Caveats</strong></h3>
            <p>Did our findings support the idea of virtual reality as the “ultimate empathy machine”? Overall, the
                answer appears to be no. In general our results suggest that the use of 360° VR as a medium for content
                delivery has no greater effect in reducing prejudice, or promoting pro-social behaviours than more
                traditional forms of media. While this outcome could be seen as disappointing for content producers who
                feel that VR offers an opportunity to change social attitudes to an extent not seen in other mediums I
                will conclude this piece by giving some brief caveats to our research and thoughts on what forms of VR
                content might prove more effective for this goal.</p>
            <p>The first thing to note is that while we did not find any strong evidence that the medium through which
                content is experienced could alter either explicit attitudes or implicit associations that does not mean
                that “Clouds Over Sidra” has no effect on viewser. In fact, we found that viewing the documentary in any
                format led to an immediate reduction in implicit bias against Arab people, suggesting that while the
                idea of VR as an <em>ultimate</em> empathy machine may, in this case, be overblown, there is support for
                Ebert’s original idea of film as a tool capable of bringing people together. The other key caveat to
                take from our research is that while 360 video is currently still the most common format of VRNF,
                largely due to its greater accessibility to content creators coming from traditional film backgrounds,
                it only scratches the surface of the potential uses of VR as a means of conveying narratives. There is
                considerable research suggesting that more immersive forms of VR, particularly those that give the
                viewer the sense of being embodied, i.e. by being able to feel or control the body of someone from a
                different ethnicity, gender or other identity, may be more effective in changing attitudes than this
                more basic form of virtual reality we examined in our study.</p>
            <p>The challenge for VRNF producers to consider as technological progression expands the capabilities of VR
                is how to avoid falling into two key traps. The first of these is the trap of improper distance
                highlighted by Nash. Her argument that VRNF can risk becoming a form of experience tourism is even
                stronger when considering experiences which don’t merely seek give us the feeling of being transported
                to the same location as a distant other but actually the sense of being that other. The second issue is
                the question of how far any VR experience that allows the user to actually interact with the world they
                are present in can be considered to be nonfictional. By definition, allowing the user to interact with
                the environment in a way that can affect the scene blurs the boundary between an accurate recounting of
                an event or experience and the creation of a fantasy narrative. Thus to the extent that nonfiction
                documentary relies on a claim to be depicting “the real”, the adoption of interactive VR in nonfiction
                means moving away from the idea of documentary as replaying “real” events and a move towards seeing VRNF
                as a means of creating “real” experiences, even at the cost of the accuracy of those experiences.</p>
            <p>Despite these challenges and considerations, however, there is already evidence that VR producers are
                rising to meet them. Jane Gauntlet’s <em>Dancing With </em>Myself, which aims to give users a sense of
                her experience in the lead-up and aftermath of an epileptic seizure, provides a nice example of an
                attempt to share experiences through embodied VR handled with care and sensitivity. Meanwhile, pieces
                that merge some aspects of traditional documentary, such as verite sound recordings, while allowing the
                user to freely explore a visual space (the BBC’s <em>Easter Rising</em> or <em>Notes on Blindness: Into
                    Darkness)</em> may point the way towards giving users a an experience grounded in historical reality
                while making the most of the interactive abilities that VR can produce. It seems likely that future
                producers of VRNF content will be able to build on the work of these early pioneers to develop a new and
                powerful grammar of VRNF.</p>
