            <p>In the months before the Apple Watch was released, nerds around the world (myself included) slow-motion
                scrubbed through ads to Kremlinologize the device’s anticipated functionality. One video seemed to
                feature animations of hand gestures — a thumbs up and a thumbs down — which I interpreted to mean that
                the bundle of optoelectronic, gyroscopic, and accelerometric sensors Apple was calling a “watch” could
                read and interpret a user’s hand gestures.</p>
            <p>I found myself wondering what programmer in which sub-basement at Apple got to decide what a thumbs up or
                down meant. How were those gestures captured in data? Did each gesture have its own spec? How would
                Apple localize movement? What assumptions regarding users’ ability, local culture, gestural semantics,
                and skin pigmentation were required to discern user intentionality? How, ultimately, did Apple
                choreograph the interface of this device, and how would it, in turn, choreograph us?</p>
            <p>I was teaching dance history at Harvard when the Watch was released, a fact I recall here because it
                happened a few weeks before one of our students, Aran Khanna, got very publicly fired from his
                internship at Facebook. Khanna had created a browser extension that scraped geolocation data from
                Facebook Messenger to make a “<a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/28/marauders-map-chrome-app-tracks-facebook-messenger">Marauders
                    Map</a>” enabling users to see friends’ realtime locations. There wasn’t an obvious way to prevent
                others from accessing the data, and more alarming still was Facebook’s apparent ability to log
                geospatial coordinates with neither users’ knowledge nor consent. I learned about the breach, fittingly,
                from my Facebook feed while across the street from Mark Zuckerburg’s former dormitory. Walking to
                seminar that day, I became fixated on the possible inferences that could be made on the basis of
                indexable location data. What patterns of life could be discerned from an individual’s (or two billion
                individuals’) movements across space and time?</p>
            <p>I should note that <a href="http://www.skybetter.org">I’m a choreographer</a>. My dances have been
                performed on stages around the country, and I am an expert in how bodies create meaning through
                movement. Up until the 2015 release of the Apple Watch and the Mauraders Map, my engrained understanding
                was that choreography was a thing for trained bodies to perform on stages in front of people. I’d never
                contemplated choreographed bodies performing for audiences of machines, let alone algorithms. At this
                point, there was no obvious group to work through this with. There was no trade association, no
                membership organization, no books or pamphlets. Yet, more instances of choreographic interfacing between
                bodies and surveillant technologies cropped up daily.</p>
            <p>It was around this time I became aware of how government intelligence entities use global positioning
                satellites, cell tower triangulation, and voice/speaker recognition to track bodies through real and
                virtual space. One top secret NSA program revealed by Edward Snowden (codenamed: CO-TRAVELER) juxtaposed
                the accumulated cell location data of known persons of interest against anyone else whose data had been
                previously collected. On this basis, the NSA was able to algorithmically hypothesize relationships
                between previously unrelated actors on the basis of shared movement patterns, (i.e. co-traveling). The
                resulting meta-data were stored in a vast digital archive called FASCIA, which, not coincidentally, is
                the anatomical term for the literally connective tissue that holds organs and muscles together. This
                body of data (or “Body of Secrets,” per journalist James Bamford) was in the service of what internal
                NSA memos describe as “all about locating, tracking, and maintaining continuity on individuals across
                space and time.”</p>
            <p>It sounded like choreography to me. Whether it’s people existing under surveillance capitalism, within a
                national security apparatus or performing in a dance show, we’re ultimately talking about the
                observation, interpretation and meaning-making of bodies in motion. It’s just that these four components
                (observation, interpretation, meaning-making, bodies in motion) used to be done exclusively by humans.
                Now, they are all increasingly accomplished by machines.</p>
            <p>I spent most of 2015 obsessed with the relationship between bodies and surveillance, but lacked obvious
                means to validate concerns for what I saw as a potential human/computer interface cluster$@*&amp;. In
                the Venn diagram of choreography and surveillance I was the only nerd I knew in the overlap, so I
                started talking to folks with backgrounds in technology and performance, if not surveillance and
                choreography specifically.</p>
            <p>I recall early discussions with software consultant, composer, and philanthropoid <a
                    href="http://kevinclarkcomposer.com/">Kevin Clark</a>, who pointed out the lack of stable
                classifiers for gesture and consequent absence of a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) for
                movement. This led to a conversation with composer <a href="https://oddnoise.com/aboutme.html">Stephan
                    Moore</a>, who had done sound design and tech for the late Merce Cunningham, and was completing a
                PhD in Computer Music and Multimedia Composition at Brown. He shared my interest in a potential
                reframing of choreography relative to emerging technologies, and volunteered his living room (and liquor
                cabinet) to facilitate future ad hoc gaggles.</p>
            <p>I took him at his word, and later that month my longtime dance colleague, <a
                    href="http://www.kateweare.com/board/Keira-Chang/">Keira Chang</a>, rented a van and picked up
                nearly a dozen art nerds from around New York City and brought them to Moore’s Rhode Island living room.
                The group notably included <a href="http://catiecuan.com/">Catie Cuan</a> (now pursuing a PhD in
                choreography and robotics at Stanford), <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/author/nece/">Victoria
                    Nece</a> (now a Senior Product Manager of Motion Graphics and Visual Effects at Adobe), dancer /
                choreographers Kristen Bell and <a href="https://www.jordanisadore.com/">Jordan Isadore</a>, Moore,
                Clark, and a handful of others working across art and industry. Sitting on Moore’s couch, I recited my
                premises and concerns: are body-sensing technologies as potentially problematic as they seem? Could
                artistic practice broadly — and choreographic practice specifically — be a means to work through such
                issues? The conclusion of the group was a resounding <em>yes</em>.</p>
            <p>A few months later, scholar Simone Browne published the brilliant “<a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015868764/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Dark
                    Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness</a>,” a horrific genealogy of surveillance technologies
                and their tendency to reiterate (and, indeed, scale) violent bias. Through Browne I learned of other
                badass theorists — Lisa Nakamura, Shoshana Magnet, Kiri Miller, and Wendy Chun — who explored embodiment
                under surveillance as a function of race and ethnicity, and who made explicit the corporeal risks of
                historical and emergent technologies.</p>
            <p>The stakes of choreographic engagement for bodies under surveillance was becoming more clear, and the
                rolodex of individuals wanting to work on the discourse was growing. We couldn’t find any extant
                convenings on the subject that foregrounded artistic research and had an explicitly anti-racist ethos,
                so we founded our own.</p>
            <p>Since 2015, I have worked alongside (my now colleague at Brown) Miller, Clark and burgeoning live arts
                producer Ariane Michaud to produce the <a href="http://www.choreotech.com">Conference for Research on
                    Choreographic Interfaces</a> (CRCI). It is dedicated it to questions of choreography and
                surveillance and operates with the belief that addressing such questions requires wildly diverse,
                intimidatingly heterogeneous expertise from culture critics, theorists, computer scientists, dancers,
                anthropologists, ethnographers, poets, improvisers, and podcasters, among others. We compose the space
                and save the time for others to move and fill with meaning. The team is careful not to separate
                art-making from more conventional research practices, and our programming brims with folks who would
                otherwise never be in dialogue.</p>
            <p>At our 2019 gathering, for example, we had Browne share her latest research with Miller alongside
                choreographer <a href="http://thefeath3rtheory.com/">Raja Feather Kelly</a>, as well as a <a
                    href="https://soundcloud.com/ontappod/on-tap-030">live-recorded theater and performance studies
                    podcast </a><em><a href="https://soundcloud.com/ontappod/on-tap-030">On TAP</a></em>, featuring
                guests from a skunkworks engineering lab at Oculus and producers from the Sundance Film Festival. CRCI
                works across traditional hierarchies of knowledge, the result of years of iterative organizing and
                community building, to permit simultaneous consideration of performance, technology, and power. While
                there have been tangible outcomes—companies started up, artistic ventures launched, IP created—such
                deliverables are less the point of the venture than the process which catalyzed them. It is the process
                that we ultimately care for the most. Most simply, my hope for CRCI is that with our powers combined,
                with all of our divergence and disagreement, this odd gaggle might eventually result in the sorts of
                art, theory, criticism, and practice that define the insurgence required to bring about a less fearful
                world.</p>

            <p>These days, I teach choreographics at Brown University. I write, speak, and consult on the braid between
                bodies and surveillant technologies, frequently with the aim of co-creating artistic research practices
                that fight for more equitable futures. CRCI is a programmatic articulation of these labors, functioning
                both as a chosen professional family and emerging field. I admit that the thing started with the
                narcissistic centering of my own weirdass research questions, though this is thankfully no longer the
                case. Already a generational shift is underway, and my role is increasingly to resource a rising class
                of dance-interested artists and engineers.</p>
            <p>Michaud — my former mentee, now programming partner — recently hired her own former intern, Kate Gow, to
                help administer the effort. Gow is a self-described “kinaestheticist” and Boston Conservatory at Berklee
                graduate with a self-designed degree in dance and technology — an orientation in part inspired by
                attending CRCI. Gow and Michaud will take over much of the management of the 2020 CRCI convening, as
                well as half a dozen other CRCI-produced gatherings in the works around the country over the next few
                years.</p>
            <p>The traction of these gaggles validates the capacity of artists — dancers, specifically — to articulate
                and combat bias in body-centric technologies. For centuries, the Western dance tradition has largely
                been about aestheticized systems of exclusion. If we consider the proscenium stage an early,
                body-centric technology of surveillance, the fact of contemporary surveillant technologies’ reinforcing
                bias is no surprise. CRCI attempts to imagine otherwise, and anyone wanting to dismantle the prior art
                of structural racism should consider themselves absolutely welcome.</p>
