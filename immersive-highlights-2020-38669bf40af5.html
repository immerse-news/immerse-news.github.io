            <p>This list highlights the creative projects that producers published last year despite the limitations of
                the pandemic. That includes augmented reality projects designed for people to use on their smartphones
                and works that were shared at film festivals that quickly pivoted to an online format. We hope you’re
                inspired by the range of aesthetics, technologies, and subject matter in these works.</p>
            <p>We asked 26 immersive creators, curators and researchers to share what works they were excited about and
                what work they were involved in.</p>

            <p>“I missed the 2016 theatrical run of Simon McBurney’s one-man show about photographer Loren McIntyre’s
                1969 encounter with the Mayorana people of the Amazon. But when Complicite decided to stream the piece
                during May’s lockdown, I was one of 70,000 people around the world who got the chance to experience it
                at home. Ensconced in headphones, with my laptop on my knee, I was transported by McBurney’s theatrical
                tour de force, as he deploys a microphone, binaural sound and minimal props to enact McIntyre’s journey,
                not across distance, but into an alternative perception of time in which the past is “alive and
                available” as “an alternative to a menacing present…of violent encroachment by white settlers” (Simon
                McBurney).” <a

                2020 festival line-up, invites you “to encounter the natural world and your place within it from a
                radically new perspective” (May Abdalla). The work was inspired by a 1980s Stanislav Lem essay which
                responded to a US Government appeal for a way to leave information behind for those who come after
                humans. The open-air experience offers a pair of participants divergent interactive audio pathways
                across time and into plant intelligence, inducing an alchemy through which a soundtrack can turn a bleak
                December park into a space of wonder.”</p>

            <p>An unprecedented collaboration with NASA, The ISS Experience utilizes custom-built virtual reality
                cameras — engineered to operate in zero-gravity. Astronauts have filmed over 200 hours of footage
                capturing their life in space.</p>

                News/HuffPost including 55 projects produced and executed by graduates of our internal training program,
                who had no prior experience working in XR before 2020. My favorite achievements of ours: <a

            <p>“Hannah Jayanti’s luminous feature documentary streamed by Sheffield DocFest in November paints vivid
                portraits of five residents of the eponymous New Mexico town. Their moving reflections on life, change
                and loss are framed in a near future in which tourist travel from the nearby Spaceport is everyday
                business. This speculative framing, an improvised soundtrack by guitar maestro Bill Frisell, and
                Alexander Porter’s evocative photogrammetry all contribute to a singular, beautiful and immersive
                nonfiction work.”</p>
