            <p>When I think about models of sustainability in immersive media, the image of tectonic plates come to
                mind: the people who survive have to stand and balance while the plates shift underneath them.</p>

            <p>Four months after I first presented this research at CPH: Dox, we still don’t have the answers. But there
                has been a lot of experimenting and acceptance of a new normal. Kent Bye wrote an excellent <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/distributing-immersive-stories-at-virtual-festivals-1048103a2292">article</a>
                about how festivals are adapting. VR headset hygiene, protocols and products have also emerged.</p>
            <p>The documentarians, artists, journalists, and curators I interviewed are working at the cusp of emerging
                media. They’re used to a constantly changing landscape—although not a pandemic! More than many, they are
                equipped to adapt. This ability is the model of sustainability. But no matter how resilient they may be,
                there needs to be a solid plate under them so that they can do their work.</p>
            <p>How do we support them so that they can push boundaries, establish more equitable practices, question
                existing models, and work outside of established norms? This article dives into ways people are trying
                to sustain themselves and what still needs to happen.</p>

            <p>Immersive media is highly interdisciplinary and makers navigate many different fields from theater to art
                to film while also navigating a newly emerging but fragile XR ecosystem.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/500/0*pRnGFvHy8WXur15h" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"

            <p>I interviewed people from the United States, Canada, and Europe, but artists in Asia—in particular China,
                Taiwan, and South Korea—are starting to gain attention in the West. Australia too has a growing
                immersive media sector.</p>
            <p>Each country and project has its own funding ecosystem and Canada, the US, England, and France produce
                the most. Overall, the countries with the most government backing fare best. Governments in Europe and
                Canada have invested considerably in immersive digital media both through their cultural funds and
                creative economy funds as well as regional funds and tax incentives. Research funding for
                university-industry partnerships is also an important source.</p>
            <p>The US government provides considerably less funding and the first wave of VR was supported by technology
                companies looking for content to sell their hardware. This funding has mostly dried up. Foundations such
                as Knight, MacArthur, and Ford also support the field. Universities are becoming an important space for
                R&amp;D, incubation and production, and they are providing much-needed research on best practices,
                potential use cases, and impact.</p>
            <p>It’s difficult for Americans to sustain their work but some people I interviewed were optimistic about
                wider adoption of VR headsets. The field is young.</p>

            <p>People employ a host of different strategies to stay afloat. This is a list of some of these strategies
                and I’ll go more deeply into these strategies in three case studies.</p>
            <h3 id="dce4">CASE STUDY 1: A Documentarian in England—Darren Emerson</h3>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/500/0*oNmDAso7E9yNKj7m" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span></figure>
            <p>Common Ground is a VR documentary that mixes archives, 360 video, photogrammetry, AR, and interaction to
                create an embodied cinematic form within the documentary tradition.</p>
            <p>Darren Emerson found that his skills as a documentarian were transferable to 360 video. He created his
                first 360 video, <em>Witness 360:7/7,</em> about a woman’s experience of a UK bombing, without external
                funding. He received a small amount of funding (5k) from Sheffield Film Festival for his second project,
                <em>Indefinite</em>, about the UK detention system.
            </p>
            <p>“We weren’t really in the world where we were getting grants or funding for original commissioned work,”
                Emerson said. “That was something I’d always wanted to do, so it was around that time when I started to
                think about <em>Common Ground</em> that I kind of said to myself, I’m going to figure out how this
                works. It might take a couple of years, but I hope, by the end of that, I’ll be in a better place to get
                funding for the work that I want to do.”</p>
            <p><em>Common Ground</em> explores the social housing experiment in 1963 in London called Aylesbury Estate,
                where thousands of Londoners live now. It’s currently being regenerated and causing significant
                controversy because of how it’s being planned and its potential impact on residents who will be priced
                out. Emerson hopes it will help people better understand what residents call their home.</p>
            <p><em>Common Ground</em> is firmly steeped in documentary practice and so it makes a good jumping off point
                to explore documentary in the context of emerging technologies. Emerson uses the affordances of VR to
                let the audience feel like they are wandering around the space and he uses AR to let audiences explore
                the rich archives of Aylesbury Estate in the virtual estate itself.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/500/0*brl3EO3DuyPrjGUs" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"

            <p>Emerson described his funders as partners. England now includes immersive media in its funds earmarked
                for culture, creative economies, and innovation/research, which Emerson was able to access.</p>
            <p>Government support is essential to his fundraising strategy, which is not unlike traditional documentary
                fundraising paths.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/500/0*rARvd8KCF0Exh954" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span></figure>
            <p>But what is notable is that he received funding from the British Film Institute Audience Fund for R&amp;D
                of a distribution plan rather than a distribution plan itself. Having a distribution plan is key to
                sustainability. Because immersive media do not have a clear, tried and true method of distribution, it
                becomes necessary to fund the research of one before it is created.</p>
            <p>Scatter Studio Creative Director Yasmin Elayat also talked about the importance of distribution
                strategies in her own work: “Every project has a budget for [distribution]. Even if we’re not raising
                it, we’re not going in blindly. [We know] this is what it would take to get this out the door and this
                is the plan.” She spent months on a distribution strategy for <em>Zero Days</em> and worked with a
                collaborator to figure out price points. Oculus, one of the funders, originally required <em>Zero
                    Days</em> to be free. Elayat did research, watched different models, and came up with a price point.

            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/500/0*LzmhtCMXtUO_PjMD" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span></figure>
            <p>Marshmallow Laser Feast is a London-based collective of virtual reality creators. They have a robust
                model of sustainability, which includes what executive producer Nell Whitley calls a “blended
                approach.”<strong> </strong>Whitley explained that they blended learnings or tools from previous
                projects to the next projects, blended platforms, and blended funders. She says it’s a lot of work
                because they not only produce their projects but they handle distribution and exhibition — roles that
                are farmed out to other companies in more established media ecosystems.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/500/0*uN_Tso_S8kP_ErlN" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span></figure>
            <p>Their first VR project, <em>In the Eyes of the Animal</em>, used a technique called “lidar scanning” to
                capture the bottom of a forest, presenting the POV of small animals such as frogs or dragon flies —
                perspectives that the human eye cannot offer.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/500/0*R6e_4I4rg7Q1rMXM" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span></figure>
            <p><em>In the Eyes of the Animal </em>was commissioned by the festival Abandon Normal Devices. Festival
                commissions were a big funding source for them and most of these festivals were not film festivals.
                Because the work is<strong> </strong>cross-disciplinary, they were able to access institutions across
                many fields. These commissions were mostly funded by government funds. Partnerships have been key and
                sometimes Whitley was able to broker partnerships between festivals in order to pay for their projects.
            </p>
            <p>With their project, <em>A </em><em><a href="http://acolossalwave.com/">Colossal Wave</a></em><a
                    href="http://acolossalwave.com/">,</a> they forged an international collaboration with companies in
                Canada, which allowed them to access funds from another country.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/500/0*HsCiHiFWPukrixkf" width="800"><label

            <p>Another part of their model of sustainability includes selling services. They make films, music videos,
                and other content for clients.</p>
            <p>They also partner with universities to access funds earmarked for research. These funds provide them with
                the resources to experiment and innovate and the findings carry over to their other projects.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/500/0*Lz5WD095hJKaW6ax" width="800"><label

            <p>Whitley talked about their strategy of adapting their projects for many other platforms. She called them
                “vintage works” and “tourable assets.” Their installations are expensive to reproduce, so they figure
                out which parts can tour or be distributed online. License fees from the Oculus store is one source of
                funding.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/500/0*tmzk-1eMN_pFDSyi" width="800"><label

            <p>A new model for the industry is a revenue-sharing model tested in the project, <em>We Live in an Ocean of
                    Air</em>.<strong> </strong>In this case, Whitley’s team found an exhibitor, Saatchi Gallery<strong>
                </strong>in London<strong>, </strong>before it created the project and used the name of the prestigious
                venue to raise funds. The group also revenue-shared through ticket sales. This revenue sharing model is
                being watched closely in the industry.</p>
            <h3 id="e6d0"><strong>Case Study 3: The American Studio</strong></h3>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/500/0*JnvkHFHKm9HweOah" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"

            <p>The American scene is its own puzzle. Without substantial government funds and diminishing support from
                tech companies, it’s a struggle for creators to show investors that money can be made from XR products.
                But there is an emerging, albeit fragile, ecosystem with spaces for incubation and exhibition, funding
                from tech companies, and some distribution avenues. As of late, the XR ecosystem has been hit hard by
                the pandemic. The Tribeca Film Institute and Sundance New Frontier have both closed.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/600/0*M_FQg7ZbHPZu4KiY" width="800"><label

            <p>Incubators, fellowships, and artists services are a key support system. NEW INC is an important incubator
                in the field<strong>. </strong>Hundreds of<strong> </strong>people working in immersive media have gone
                through their program. They have a new initiative, ONX (funded in collaboration with Onassis USA), which
                will provide an accelerator program, work space and exhibition space — all holes in the existing
                infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Organizations such as Mozilla, United Artists, Ford Foundation and MIT Open Documentary Lab‘s Co-Creation
                Studio all offer funded fellowships. A fellowship is an excellent model of sustainability because it
                supports the artist, not just a project. Artists services agencies such as Kaleidoscope offer a
                compelling model; they are trying to help artists every step of the way, from fundraising to
                distribution and exhibition.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/500/0*kNPA5fJvVvj_LSFb" width="800"><label

            <p>Tech companies in search of content to sell their hardware have been a key funding source. VR headsets
                companies such as Oculus and Samsung drove the increase in content creation around 2016–17. That funding
                slowed down since VR headsets didn’t sell the way the companies hoped. But tech companies are still
                funding some content, including Ryot Studio, which is part of Verizon Media.</p>
            <p>Scatter, an immersive media studio based in Brooklyn, is using the tool-building method to create
                revenue. Scatter’s tool is called <a href="https://www.depthkit.tv/">DepthKit</a>, a volumetric
                filmmaking kit, and Scatter is also creating the community around volumetric filmmaking.</p>
            <p>Creators build the field—not only their projects—as they go along.</p>

            <p>There was a notable distribution deal back in 2018 at Sundance when CityLights, a Los Angeles-based, VR
                financing and distribution studio bought the rights to <em>Spheres</em> for seven figures. Before the
                virus outbreak, people were looking towards public location-based exhibition spaces. But with the virus
                outbreak, people are still looking at public spaces for XR even more creatively while also more
                seriously considering web possibilities, headset improvements, and streaming.</p>

            <p>It takes a village to show your piece and have impact. This is from the website of the project
                <em>Tree</em> by Winslow Porter and Milicia Zec. <em>Tree</em> has toured extensively, including at the
                World Economic Forum.

            <p>How will the field evolve?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wider VR headset adoption?</li>
                <li>More funders?</li>
                <li>More incubators, accelerators and fellowships, collectives?</li>
                <li>New spaces?</li>
                <li>Streaming experiences?</li>
            </ul>
