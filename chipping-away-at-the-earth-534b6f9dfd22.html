            <h3 id="434f">A conversation with curator, film scholar and place-maker Greg de Cuir Jr. on desktop cinema
                aesthetics, handmade digital exhibitions and the metaverse now</h3>
            <p>Wearing multiple hats in championing experimental moving image and developing how it circulates, Greg de
                Cuir Jr. is an independent curator, film scholar, the managing editor of the open-source, peer-reviewed
                journal of media studies <em>NECSUS</em> (Amsterdam University Press), translator and curator of the
                Alternative Film/Video Festival in Belgrade, where he hosts the Alternative Research Forum every winter.
                He’s curated the Black Light Retrospective for the 2019 Locarno Film Festival, the 2018 Flaherty Seminar
                with Kevin Jerome Everson, and at Anthology Film Archives (New York), Eye Filmmuseum (Amsterdam), and
                Kino Arsenal (Berlin), just to name a few of the institutions where he’s presented work.</p>
            <p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I noticed that de Cuir had uniquely adapted his nimble, thoughtful practice
                to virtual conditions. Though I was familiar with de Cuir’s scholarship on the Yugoslav Black Wave,
                Black experimental film, and interviews with filmmakers about film festivals, I was excited to encounter
                projects like “<a
                    href="https://mediacityfilmfestival.com/dark-dark-gallery-radical-acts-of-care/">Radical Acts of
                    Care</a>,” hosted at the Media City Film Festival’s online exhibition space, the Dark Dark Gallery,
                from August 27–September 27, 2020. The digital-only exhibit featured a restoration of Forough
                Farrokhzad’s masterpiece <em>The House is Black</em> (1962) as well as new work and audio conversations
                recorded and created during the COVID-19 lockdowns from critics, musicians, artists and filmmakers, all
                presented within a website created just for the exhibit. Unlike the cookie-cutter streaming platforms
                used by most other “virtual cinemas,” online film festival portals, and video on demand, “Radical Acts
                of Care” unfolds like an accordion book with multiple chapters. Its format stood out to me as a patient
                and fully conceptualized response to the potential of digital exhibition of moving image work, matching
                the interrogation of the concept of “care” expressed in de Cuir’s program notes.</p>
            <p>Since then, de Cuir co-hosted a conference on desktop cinema for the 2020 Alternative Research Forum,
                developed and facilitated a workshop on the same for the <a
                    href="https://www.blackstarfest.org/seminar/">William and Louise Greaves Filmmaker Seminar</a> (a
                project from Philadelphia’s BlackStar Film Festival), and started a digital consultancy called <a
                    href="https://www.expoblvd.com/projects/">EXPOBLVD</a> that produced <a
                    href="http://cryptofashionweek.xyz/">Crypto Fashion Week</a> with Universe Contemporary in February
                2021, and is about to launch a follow-up called <a href="http://metavs.art/">META_VS</a>, running from
                April 5–10, 2021. META_VS is an expansive and ambitious digital art exhibition across three separate
                platforms, none of which will require special headsets or software to access, other than a web browser.
                The festivities also include drop parties and NFT auctions of new work, and drops that are NFTs.</p>
            <p>Intrigued by de Cuir’s fluid curatorial and critical interests in claiming digital connectivity and new
                platforms for moving image artists, we discussed his many past and upcoming projects. This interview has
                been edited for length and clarity.</p>

            <p><strong>Immerse: In the call for proposals for the Alternative Research Forum, you and co-organizer
                    Miriam de Rosa positioned the conference as reading desktop cinema through Harun Farocki’s idea of
                    the operational image. What I have casually seen in the US is that the types of images used in
                    widely released desktop films have a slick, forward-momentum, swiping kind of energy. In addition,
                    through the pandemic, we have had a greater exposure to video calls and Zoom aesthetics. Has this
                    changed how things are being theorized and what you’re seeing, or are you going further back in
                    history?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>de Cuir</strong>: Depending on the community or the point of engagement, we can trace some
                similarities in desktop aesthetics. As a historian of film, I’m always interested in tracing historical
                trajectories of people like Farocki, and before him essayistic traditions and principles in television
                and video art. Where does desktop comes from? In the visual arts world, people make desktop work as
                artistic expressions. We can also talk about the academic edge of the videographic assemblage of desktop
                practitioners, how they speak about collapsing research and practice. Or we can talk about a net art or
                digital art. Then the desktop becomes much broader as a site of convergence. What did desktop look like
                when there were no desktops?</p>
            <p>Desktop, like many things, has often been practiced and discussed and shown primarily through a white
                lens. I’m interested in cracking that lens a little bit and saying, well, people of color practice
                desktop also. Depending on how much we want to expand, we can also talk about YouTube videos and the
                desktop practices that are inherent there. Like you said, people now are used to video conferencing.
                Zoom very quickly and very seamlessly took over a lot of our frames of references. The desktop and the
                video frames within desktop are now a lingua franca that all people can speak and engage with.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: What are some of the differences that you are seeing, in terms of how people of color
                    are utilizing this space? Are you framing this presentation at BlackStar’s Filmmaking Seminar as a
                    form of recovery or excavation, getting people’s eyes on these creators and their works?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>de Cuir: I’ve only engaged with the festival from a distance but I like the intersectionality that
                they’re practicing. I like how they’re bringing Indigenous peoples, which means different things in
                different continents and different regions, and peoples of color into the fold. I think that’s a really
                strong way to move the festival into the future. So I’m just trying to kind of mirror that with this
                program. Let’s see what people in North America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and South Asia are doing and add
                their conversations to the broader picture. Maybe there are going to be some members in the audience
                that don’t know anything about desktop or that genre of image-making we call desktop cinema. Where has
                that come from?</p>
            <p>You can make the argument that one of the most important artists in recent years, Arthur Jafa, is making
                desktop cinema. “Love is the message, the message is Death” (2017) is a desktop film. He won the Golden
                Lion at the Venice Biennial for “The White Album” (2018), which is a desktop work. Is it not? That’s all
                about internet archives and the interface of the desktop. So you could argue, therefore, that desktop
                cinema has already reached the highest pinnacle of the art world.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: In terms of where his work is being shown, I think about the music video that Jafa made
                    for Kanye West last summer and how that has gotten millions of views on YouTube and it’s almost all
                    found footage with a desktop aesthetic.</strong></p>
            <p>de Cuir: Yeah, we have to have wider discussions. The music videos that he made for Kayne and for Jay-Z
                is all stuff I watched on my computer. I’m old enough to remember MTV Raps and music videos on TV. And
                now I never watch music videos on TV. The main carrier now is the desktop screen, but if everything’s
                desktop, then nothing is desktop.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: One could even argue that watching a Kanye West music video on your desktop is a
                    slightly retrograde way of encountering this work, because so many people only watch YouTube on
                    their phones.</strong></p>
            <p>de Cuir: Exactly. We have to talk about the difference between the mobile screen and the desktop screen.
                We could talk about desktop cinema not as a genre or an aesthetic, but as a middle platform strategy. We
                can talk about Sundance and all these festivals that are practicing desktop cinema. It’s sort of a
                direct correlation to what they were trying to do IRL, but we could and should talk about desktop
                <em>cinemas </em>as the new cinemas. Who knows when this pandemic will end, but for a lot of people in
                the world, forget about cinema, unless you can watch it on a computer.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: I would like to shift our conversation to your new consultancy, EXPOBLVD, and your work
                    on Crypto Fashion Week. This isn’t the first digital fashion week. What was interesting to you about
                    this space?</strong></p>
            <p>de Cuir: I got into it through a colleague of a friend, Lady Phe0nix, the founder of Universe
                Contemporary. I’m advising on events and public programs for Universe Contemporary, which is a boutique
                consultancy specializing in crypto and digital art, dealing with the formation and management of
                collections. They also did a <a href="https://cryptobasel.art/">Crypto Basel</a>, which I worked on, and
                where Miriam and I did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp-45lwGo18">talk on desktop</a>. The
                idea of doing a crypto fashion week came from the same principles, which is to intervene in a space and
                to gather some of these interdisciplinary actors together: designers, old school fashion, new school
                fashion, and technologists that don’t have anything to do with art or culture or fashion.</p>
            <p>The idea is to gauge what’s happening with blockchain technology and how that’s influencing the way
                people are thinking about fashion from consumer, artistic, collectible and engagement standpoints. We’ll
                mix and mingle that with exhibitions, runway shows, discussions and exhibitions. It’ll all be completely
                online because this is not even the path to the future, it’s the path to the now. We’re building it
                independently, in the radical sense of doing everything decentralized and on our own.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: My sense of fashion week is that it is overloaded with brand sponsorships who bring in
                    influencers and photographers and populate their runway front rows with celebrities. Will Crypto
                    Fashion Week be browser-based? Will there be a VR access point so people can wear digital fashion
                    while attending?</strong></p>

            <p>de Cuir: Our tagline for the event is where the immutable meets wearable. So it’s all these things that
                you mentioned, first of all, in terms of platforms and the way people will engage with it. We’re going
                to be doing talks in Clubhouse, which is interesting not only because you can’t see anyone, but because
                it’s buzzy. Some of the people we’re working with have contracts with major fashion houses, magazines,
                or whoever they’re working for, where they’re not allowed to speak on camera without prior approval.
                Clubhouse also gives us an opportunity to include some people who can’t officially represent their
                company in the news media. In terms of the exhibitions and the runway shows, we’re planning on utilizing
                the metaverse and building some totally immersive virtual experiences.</p>
            <p>In terms of your question about how much is this going to be like an IRL fashion week, there’s different
                schools of thought. Take film festivals, for example, there’s one school that practices, not explicitly
                — but a lot of festivals are just trying to replicate the IRL experience as closely as possible online.
                They’re in the battle at this moment to keep their festivals float, keep their audiences and scratch and
                claw for relevance in this world where everybody’s schedules are collapsed. There’s another school of
                thought that I think needs to be developed further, whether it’s the fashion week or the film festival
                experience. What should a film festival look like online? What could, and should a fashion week look
                like online? In other words, let’s use our imagination and let’s create a different world.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: It’s a forward-thinking perspective as opposed to one that strives to recreate a system
                    that wasn’t working for everyone anyway.</strong></p>
            <p>de Cuir: We can try to recreate, but for me, that’s also a little bit of a lost opportunity. With “<a
                    href="https://mediacityfilmfestival.com/dark-dark-gallery/">Radical Acts of Care</a>,” the original
                idea was that it was going to be an IRL exhibition at a museum in Detroit, but it hadn’t been developed.
                I had never seen the space. We were free and untethered in that sense, but still the idea for me was,
                okay, I don’t want to do something that looks like this is just translated online. Not that I was so
                presumptuous to say, I’m going to pioneer a new exhibition that nobody’s ever seen. It’s more thinking
                about what works for this site, for this space, for these artists, for these works.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: Previously we had talked about how you wanted to carry over a handmade feel into that
                    exhibit. At that point in summer 2020, we’d already seen institutions that had very courageously and
                    laboriously ported their entire festival online on very short notice, from CPH:DOX to Visions du
                    Réel. VdR instituted a ticket cap that was the exact capacity of the IRL theaters that the films had
                    already been scheduled in, which was to me a strange practice at the time. But it’s one that has
                    become standardized within the online film festival space — distributors and even filmmakers
                    themselves are demanding ticket caps from festivals. Can you walk me through some of the decisions
                    that you made for “Radical Acts of Care” with Media City Film Festival and what limitations or
                    restrictions you had?</strong></p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/514/0*wv7hHBIAP3IjUXAt.jpg" width="800"><label
                    class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input class="margin-toggle"
                    type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span></figure>
            <p>de Cuir: There were absolutely limitations and restrictions, but I embraced them I like to let fate step
                in and decide the way things need to be, and then I try to bend my creativity around those turns and
                corners and see where it leads me. Media City Film Festival is not a huge corporate or huge commercial
                festival. I worked hand in hand with Oona Mosna, the founder and director of the festival. Our team was
                a web designer and an audio producer. In some cases we were limited by the templates for the site
                because we didn’t necessarily have the time, money, or workforce to build something from scratch. We had
                to creatively work through the way you scroll through the exhibition in terms of the interplay between
                the vertical and the horizontal (the way the cinema screen or the way film strips progress or the way
                the desktop interface works).</p>
            <p>We also tried to show pieces that fit this mode. Marietjie Pauw and Garth Erasmus from South Africa
                created sound pieces in quarantine, sending mobile app sound recordings back and forth to each other and
                created an experimental album using traditional instruments and a flute. Not only did their pieces speak
                this moment that we were living in, but people could also listen to those tracks while they were
                exploring other parts of the gallery. Every decision was made with Oona — we vibe off each other and
                improvised back and forth the same way that Garth and Marietjie improvise their music. The simplicity of
                the exhibition also hopefully helped people navigate through the chapters because they could take it and
                come back to it, but still feel that they have the larger topography of it in their mind.</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: I thought it was really sensitive to how people use the internet to encounter work
                    because of this episodic structure. I didn’t feel like I was obligated to encounter it all at once
                    if I don’t want to.</strong></p>
            <p>de Cuir: I tried to write this exhibition the way I would write an essay and Oona is very into poetry. We
                didn’t want it to be a flat exhibition. Cross-disciplinarity is a way toward interactivity, for people
                be able to navigate that digital gesture and feel like you could hold this exhibition in your hand and
                really flip through it, almost like a book at your leisure. I forget about all the unique, interesting
                radical and independent programs from museums, galleries, or digital native spaces, whether it’s
                different apps, Instagram, or whatever. God, there’s a million things. Our hope was that some of these
                pieces would be interesting enough so people would actually want to come back and slow down their pace a
                little bit; a lot of what I do is “less is more.”</p>
            <p><strong>Immerse: The EXPOBLVD website is itself an act of curation in and of itself to list everything
                    that you’re involved with. You also note decoloniality prominently as one of the services you
                    provide. How did EXPOBLVD come about?</strong></p>
            <p>de Cuir: Operating independently with curating, writing, or researching here and there, you have to work
                on a lot of projects just to stay alive and to feed yourself and your family. A year or two ago, I
                wanted to organize my professional work more. I started the consultancy because I wanted to work on more
                projects on a strategic and conceptual development level rather than primarily doing things on a more
                granular level. Through the consultancy, I’m assembling teams and managing and organizing projects, but
                I’m still taking that hat off and putting on the hat of an independent curator and writer, writing
                essays and organizing exhibitions. As I grow in my career, I often need new challenges. That’s why I’m
                now getting into blockchain, digital fashion and working with nonprofits and foundations on building
                institutions.</p>
            <p>Decoloniality intersects with all of those things because who I am, where I come from, the way I move,
                talk, and operate. I carry that within my spirit, my soul and my whole background. Whether you’re an
                arts institution, a film festival, a university, or a corporate brand, everybody’s trying to figure out
                this reckoning that we’re in socially, economically, racially, and ethnically. I’m from Los Angeles
                originally, and I spent a number of years in Hollywood literally working in diversity and
                multiculturalism. I believe principles of decoloniality and actions can tear down existing structures
                that have often oppressed people and create new ways to make an equitable society going forward.
                Sometimes I know I’m sitting in an audience of people that are like me, and I know they’re already going
                to like this because they saw me talk about this before. I very much often want to challenge people and
                organizations to see things differently and do things differently. And if I can do that, I can hopefully
                use that as a way to chip away at the earth and leave it in a tiny bit better shape, and hopefully other
                people will do the same.</p>
            <p>This is a moment where people are, again, finding a lot of promise online in decentralization,
                blockchain, and these crypto spaces; people are very aware that these huge digital corporations are
                running a lot of our lives. People are seeing some ways of removing some of these structures that are
                controlling things or finding new worlds — virtual reality is one of those things. I know the architects
                of the internet say, “We’ve been through this before. The internet was supposed to be a great open space
                and look what happens.” That’s the Marxist lesson that we can take to heart: history repeats itself.
                Maybe now we’re in another moment where a new generation says, instead, “Hey, you know, I don’t have to
                do things the way you old folks who invented the internet did it, I’m going to build this safe space for
                my friends and my community this way.” That’s happening and will continue to happen. There are new
                playing fields that are wide open. Let’s see if we can do the right thing with them.</p>
