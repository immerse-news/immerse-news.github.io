            <blockquote>
                <p>…we need to think deeply about whether art is used as a social glue, to bring our communities
                    together, or whether it acts, as it sometimes still does, as a social solvent, dividing our
                    communities by social and cultural status.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>We will need to support new types of experiences, in new types of institutions; work with new
                    processes and find new ways to collaborate, and build new social structures, new infrastructure, and
                    support new ecosystems.</p>

                years and was a pioneer in the field of interaction design. Barton talks about working at the “mish-mash
                of space and storytelling.” In 2003 Local Projects helped develop StoryCorps and have worked with
                museums like Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, The Legacy Museum, National September 11 Memorial and Museum,
                Cleveland Museum of Art, as well as hospitals, schools and other spaces. To hear more about these

            <blockquote>
                <p>Most technology is made for one person or for you to extract information from the interface. We build
                    interfaces that are social — they are meant to have a secondary experience. This is a very important
                    distinction that comes out of the physical space itself.</p>
