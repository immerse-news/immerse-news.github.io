            <p><em>By Cara Mertes, Director, JustFilms, Creativity and Free Expression, Ford Foundation</em></p>
            <p>“Story and narrative are the code for humanity’s operating system. Emerging media cannot risk limited
                inclusion and suffer the same pitfalls of traditional media. The stakes are too high…” This is just one
                of the compelling insights noted by Kamal Sinclair, a leading emerging media expert and director of
                Sundance Institute’s New Frontier Lab Programs.</p>
            <p>Her recent report, <em><a href="https://makinganewreality.org/">Making A New Reality</a></em>, maps the
                landscape for emerging media, including immersive media such as virtual reality, augmented reality, 360
                degree storytelling, hyper-reality and more. It extends to also look at the impact of artificial
                intelligence, ambient data, wired environments, and biomedia in the storytelling landscape. It is an
                unparalleled resource, culled from more than 100 interviews and research across the field.</p>
            <p>This expansive reflection will continue to be released over the next six months on <em><a
                        href="http://immerse.news">Immerse</a></em>, covering many of the current debates in emerging
                media against a backdrop of changing business models, creative experimentation and millions of dollars
                of investment in both content creators and tech platforms such as Oculus and Magic Leap. The forthcoming
                recommendations lay the groundwork for the interventions social justice philanthropy and other
                donors/investors can consider as tech-enabled creative and immersive storytelling catapults toward
                becoming the dominant story experience for Generation Z and beyond.</p>
            <p><em>Making A New Reality</em> is one of several recent initiatives and projects being funded by Ford
                Foundation’s JustFilms, which supports creative moving image storytellers and the organizations and
                networks that enable their work. Exploratory funding has focused on three integrated components over the
                last two years:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em><strong>Research</strong></em><em> into and analysis of new forms in emerging media, their
                        economies, structures and blindspots, and recommendations for interventions by social justice
                        philanthropy;</em></li>
                <li><em><strong>Access</strong></em><em> to experimentation for artists of color and socially engaged
                        artists to develop new frameworks, languages and agendas for the present and future of
                        tech-enabled storytelling, and;</em></li>
                <li><em><strong>Content funding</strong></em><em> for immersive story experiments rooted in and/or
                        co-created by community members adversely impacted by inequality.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Why is now the right time for social justice philanthropy to engage with emerging media? The field is
                young, access for creators is extremely limited, adoption rates for audiences are projected to soar, and
                emerging media will be a site of convergence for all of Ford’s <a
                    href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/challenging-inequality/creativity-and-free-expression/">Creativity
                    and Free Expression</a> (CFE) fields: creative documentary forms (JustFilms), journalism, and the
                arts.</p>
            <p>CFE’s overarching priorities guided the effort:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring greater access to making and using socially engaged content for both creators and audiences
                    from traditionally underserved backgrounds and perspectives;</li>
                <li>Supporting more sustainable, equitable and inclusive ecosystems in CFE’s fields.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The current explorations were designed to inquire into each of these areas in emerging media.</p>
            <h3 id="6042">Immersive media in its infancy</h3>
            <p>The advances in designing immersive narrative experiences are swiftly reshaping the landscape of
                storytelling at a level and pace unseen since the invention of the moving image. More than 120 years
                ago, cinematic technology emerged and developed into a remarkably intimate yet crowd-based narrative
                experience through the projection of images and sound on a large screen.</p>
            <p>This appealed to the imagination and emotions of viewers in ways that had not been achieved before.
                Cinema did not replace the previously dominant story technology, the book, but moving image storytelling
                became ascendent in the 20th century. The screens have changed over time, as has the pre-eminence of the
                theatrical experience in favor of individual viewing on smaller screens, but the grammar of moving image
                storytelling has largely been codified.</p>
            <p>With the evolution of the digital age comes a new frontier of immersive expression, already proving
                potent in ways that humans haven’t experienced before, according to research at Stanford University
                Virtual Human Interaction Lab. And the development of its language, aesthetics and politics is still
                forming.</p>
            <p>It is early days now for immersive media, and though it is a moving image storytelling approach, emerging
                media can be seen as a related but distinct field of practice where cinema, journalism, sculpture,
                performance, visual arts, radio, music and theatre all can provide inspiration, and coding is the new
                architecture. The experience of VR or AR is still clunky, inelegant and messy — all hallmarks of its
                emergent status — but the field is evolving quickly, and the short-form experiences being created today
                are experiments searching for the theory and practice that will inform next generations of experience.
            </p>
            <p>One of the differences between film and immersive media is that one is external, and the other seeks to
                trick the mind into thinking it is an experience internal to the body and mind. Cinema is outside the
                body. Immersive media are trying to transport your mind and body into another world that feels real,
                engaging all human senses, essentially comprising an alternative experience of reality in a digitally
                coded environment. The effect of these new approaches on humans is not well-understood yet, though
                research points to its powerful stimulation effects in the brains of people experiencing immersive
                media, particularly in VR. This has been convincing enough that NGOs, and most famously, the United
                Nations, began using VR in 2015 with <em>Clouds Over Sidra. </em>More experiments have followed, and VR
                has attracted those trying to relay the importance of pressing contemporary issues, such as forced
                immigration and other humanitarian crises.</p>
            <p>The attraction of social justice-oriented organizations to the technology lay in its novelty, efficiency
                and potential impact. In a short amount of time, VR seemed capable of introducing viewers more actively
                into new environments where they could better simulate the experience of “being there.” A more authentic
                immersive narrative experience seemed to help users identify better with the realities of other people.
                It promised to create a feeling of connectedness and thereby elicit sympathy, empathy and even
                compassion. For organizations such as the International Rescue Committee and the UN, this could
                potentially unlock a greater willingness to engage in problem solving, and was seen to increase donation
                levels at events featuring VR. It was initially understood as a new, more powerful “empathy machine,”
                adapted from critic Roger Ebert, who once described cinema in these terms.</p>
            <p>With such a potentially transformative set of story technologies under development taking this turn
                toward social justice causes, it was time to learn and experiment. Drawing from analyses across
                documentary, the arts and journalism, it was immediately clear that the lack of any kind of diversity
                across the supply chain of immersive media was a red flag, The continuing consolidation of a lucrative
                field by men was in danger of being repeated, and needed recognition and recommendations for
                transformation moving forward.</p>
            <p>Querying the relations of power and privilege in the process of immersive storymaking and distribution
                was another area of focus, as was a better understanding of the narrative frameworks and strategies that
                are becoming accepted. The impact of these experiences on individual and societal values, beliefs and
                actions over time is key. Finally, importing the attention-based commercial business models of the first
                generation of moving-image story approaches — film, TV and video journalism — a path followed by social
                media giants, could guarantee that a crisis in diversity in immersive media would be dwarfed by the
                larger challenge to democracy itself, which is now unfolding.</p>
            <h3 id="45c5">The human paradox and storytelling</h3>
            <p>Immersive media is in its shiny new toy phase, and there are those who believe it will change the world
                for the better by bringing people closer together across faith, race, class, gender, ability and caste.
                Some hope it will potentially dissolve “othering” by tapping into the human ability to create common
                cause across divides. And there is evidence to support immersive media’s capacity to stimulate powerful
                reactions and emotions.</p>
            <p>But as with everything human, what is life-enhancing can also be life threatening. Homo sapiens has
                developed a remarkable capacity for holding contradictory impulses. Violence and generosity exist side
                by side in every person.</p>
            <p>People’s ability to rationalize such divergent behavior is supported by the worldview and value systems
                we architect and implement through our cultural practices; our traditions, customs, rules and norms. In
                his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn remarked on this: “If only there were
                evil people out there, insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were just simple — we could separate
                them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of
                every human being. And who among us is willing to destroy a piece of their own heart.”</p>
            <p>The stories we tell ourselves in part work to relieve the sometimes unbearable contradiction of the human
                condition, which is defined by capacities for compassion and cruelty in equal measure. With human nature
                so contradictory, it follows that human inventions, which are intended for good outcomes, also yield the
                opposite. Note virtual reality philosopher Jaron Lanier’s recent insight in a <em>New York Times</em>
                interview: “The whole Internet thing was supposed to create the world’s best information resource in all
                of history. Everything would be made visible. And instead we are living in a time of total opacity where
                you don’t know why you see the news that you see…You don’t know who has paid to change what you see.”
            </p>
            <p>The world is only beginning to see how dangerous this inversion from transparency to opacity will be as
                inequality grows exponentially. This same question is paramount as immersive story technologies become
                more sophisticated. How can society be mindful in the design phase to create the most inclusive,
                thoughtful and community-centered approaches, rather than relying solely on traditional for-profit and
                scaling models of tech development?</p>
            <h3 id="6afe">What the independent film movement can teach us now</h3>
            <p>Coming from a background in independent media and the arts, this moment strikes me as one akin to the
                early years of the independent media movement in America. The invention of portable video technology
                catalyzed new story forms (video art, reality TV, video journalism) and created new audiences. Its
                affordability and accessibility democratized access to the means of production. The subsequent
                independent media field that formed was dynamic and powerful in its critique of the failings of a media
                system organized around marketplace incentives that saw viewers as consumers, not citizens. Independent
                documentary in particular was rooted in a commitment to critiquing power structures, validating
                underrepresented perspectives, and revealing abuse, corruption and exploitation.</p>
            <p>Contained in the decades of extraordinary documentaries and media initiatives that ensued is a story of
                this country’s struggles against injustice and exclusionary policies, values and beliefs. From Fred
                Wiseman’s 50-year project of documentation of American institutions, to the <em>Eyes on the Prize
                </em>series — which ushered in an era of television histories from more inclusive points of view —
                independent media has redefined the American experience for generations. Now we are in yet another
                golden age of documentary artistry, shown on public media and cable, Netflix and Amazon, with a treasure
                trove of films and episodic documentary linked to broader efforts to build dignified and complex
                representations of contemporary reality.</p>
            <p>But with all of its success in creating a vital source of counter-narratives to those dictated by
                commercial and other powerful interests, independent media’s Achilles heel was, and still is, its lack
                of diversity in voice and story. Transforming this status quo in film, arts and journalism is a central
                tenet of Ford’s strategy through Creativity and Free Expression, and emerging media is no exception.</p>
            <p>Can society afford to repeat the same mistake in the 21st century, with the next era of digital story
                experiences in development, just as a retreat from democracy is sweeping the globe? Now, in the early
                years of immersive media, at a time when inequality is growing exponentially, philanthropy could be
                poised to provide the crucial initial funding that allows a diverse and creative field of practice to
                grow.</p>
            <h3 id="99a5">This is the moment for greater foundation investment</h3>
            <p>The speed and scale of the transformation in the story landscape is breathtaking. Sinclair’s report,
                <em>Making A New Reality</em>, details how we are at a prime moment of intervention with the next wave
                of new story technologies: “It is imperative that we engineer robust participation of people from a
                broad set of communities, identity groups, value systems, and fields of knowledge in this emerging media
                landscape, in all roles and levels of power,” she writes. “This will help to mitigate the pitfalls of
                disruption and potentially usher in a change that has justice and equity as core values,” she writes.
            </p>
            <p>How can structural inequities be addressed earlier in the immersive story industry and its spaces of
                experimentation? What are the changes we must strive for in the business model itself in order to attain
                greater equity and inclusion in decision-making? If our efforts are toward greater justice, what are the
                most fruitful story-centered strategies for transforming unjust conditions?</p>
            <p>Creating access for content makers in this moment just before mass audiences adopt these new storytelling
                technologies is crucial to the development of the aesthetic language itself, as well as fueling a
                subsequent critical discourse that is centered squarely in building a more inclusive and equitable body
                of commentary that adds to the larger discussions. The two labs being supported by JustFilms provide
                opportunities for artists of color in Canada and the U.S., and in Africa to experiment with immersive
                storytelling and share what they’re learning with the field.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In 2016, six Canadian indigenous artists joined six artists of color from the American South in the
                    first <em>Open Immersion Lab</em>. Over 10 days, they generated a ground-breaking set of VR
                    prototypes stemming from deeply discussed questions around who represents which stories from what
                    perspective, and how the experience of the story source is honored. This partnership with the
                    National Film Board of Canada and the Canadian Film Center will continue with writings,
                    presentations and a further set of experimentation as a second year unfolds.</li>
                <li><em>Electric South | New Dimension</em> is taking a different tack. Taking place outside of
                    Capetown, South Africa, in 2017, 10 African artists joined a set of mentors to conceptualize VR
                    projects that break the boundaries of conventional VR practice. Coming from fashion, sculpture,
                    journalism, film and poetry, these creators were invited to experiment with radically re-centered
                    approaches rooted in celebrations of reimagined worlds and the power of radical imaginaries, as well
                    as drawing from experiences of exclusion and injustice. The sketches that emerged ranged from
                    Afro-futuristic to poetry-infused experiences to game-based immersion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In content funding, the Emmy-Award winning VR <em>Collisions</em>, by Lynette Wallworth, and
                <em>Unrest</em>, by Jennifer Brea, use VR less to disseminate information-based stories. Rather, each
                artist sees VR as a site where mythology, the imaginary and the psychological meet the real world in
                journeys across time and space. Walworth, who is premiering the JustFilms-supported <em>Awavena</em> at
                Sundance 2018 and at Davos 2018, says of VR, “The technologies are not superior, they are adequate
                vessels to hold the seed of complex world views, synthesized into a digital drama, as a real attempt at
                connection, illumination, and in the hope of effecting real world change.”
            </p>
            <p>Continuing to combine research with practice, the results of MIT’s Open Documentary Lab’s deep foray into
                co-creation and its implications for community-based storytelling in both traditional and immersive
                practices will be the subject of a convening and research report in 2018, currently titled
                <em>Collective Wisdom</em>. Authors Katerina Cizek, William Uricchio and Sarah Wolozin have so far
                conducted more than 40 interviews and in the process developed a taxonomy of co-creation, spanning from
                community-centered co-creation to humans with machine learning and biotech hybrids.
            </p>
            <p>Cizek asks, “How can media makers work with citizens, communities, scholars, technologists and machines
                to not only interpret the world but change it? How is co-creation understood and defined across
                disciplines from documentary, journalism and humanities to technology and industrial design?” The report
                will provide case studies of initiatives such as the Detroit Narrative Agency, another effort supported
                by JustFilms, as it examines the emerging arena at the nexus of film/narrative, community co-creation,
                civic strengthening and the human-machine interface.</p>
            <h3 id="2796">Furthering inclusion, creativity and experimentation</h3>
            <p>Ford Foundation is just one funder exploring this arena from a social justice perspective. Beyond the
                work in CFE, its Internet Freedom area is focused on digital rights and public technology
                infrastructure. Peer funders including the Knight Foundation and MacArthur Foundation are also actively
                supporting research and initiatives in emerging media fields such as journalism, as they develop and
                adopt immersive media approaches. For this field of emerging media to grow with equity and inclusion as
                a central commitment, support can be scaled or more limited and targeted. It can range from funding
                content production to platform innovation, to education, mentorship and visibility opportunities, to
                developing relevant critical analysis and curatorial expertise, or a mix of these, as Ford has done.</p>
            <p>Community based foundations and local funders could also have a chance to bring these groundbreaking
                experiences to their own backyards. It bears remembering that foundations and other patrons have
                supported artists, journalists and documentarians in creating many of the forms that now feed into
                immersive storytelling, as well as socially relevant digital productions and “tech for good”
                initiatives. Supporting scholars, publications and others who are tracking emerging media can also make
                clear not just the potential of these technologies, but the dangers: How they are used for repression,
                surveillance, or propaganda, how we risk losing privacy and control over our own data and networks.</p>
            <p>So, this is only the next phase of existing philanthropic practices. Traditional narrative practice like
                documentary has long been aligned with grassroots advocacy and direct action. While emerging media may
                seem elite and abstract right now, these new forms are becoming mainstreamed, and have the potential to
                catalyze change on the ground and influence thought and policy leaders in ways that bring more resources
                to bear on urgent social issues. As 2018 unfolds and the convergence of film, the arts, journalism, and
                other forms of expression and technology accelerates, JustFilms and Ford Foundation will continue to
                build new field knowledge and share findings about the promise and peril of emerging media.</p>
