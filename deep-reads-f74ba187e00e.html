            <p>Adrienne Russell’s <em><a

                        as Activism: Recoding Media Power</a></em><em> </em>(2016) examines the intersection between
                digital journalism and digital organizing in light of recent movements, arguing that our existing models
                for understanding how media power functions are no longer useful.</p>
            <p>In her book,<em> </em><a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/Pixels-Place-Designing-Experience-Physical/dp/0692732268/">Pixels and
                    Place: Connecting Human Experience Across Physical and Digital Spaces</a><em> </em>(2016), tech
                humanist Kate O’Neill offers insights from the digital marketing world on intentionally combining online
                and analog experiences to achieve desired outcomes — relevant for virtual activists seeking to make
                change.</p>
            <p>Taylor Owen’s <em><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Disruptive-Power-Digital-Studies-Politics/dp/0199363862/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484691943&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=disruptive+power">Disruptive
                        Power</a></em><em> </em>(2105) explores how networked movements use digital technologies to
                challenge state power and threaten existing institutions, and how the state is responding to modern
                forms of virtual civil disobedience.</p>
            <p>In this popular 2014 <a

                    Talk</a>, Zeynep Tufekci argues that while digital tools have made political organizing easier, they
                have not necessarily led to better outcomes than old-school methods of organizing did. She asks: “In
                embracing digital platforms for activism and politics, are we overlooking some of the benefits of doing
                things the hard way?”</p>
            <p>University of Illinois at Chicago Professor Zizi Papacharissi explores whether current technologies are
                democratizing, including whether digital political behaviors are collective or “atomized” in <em><a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Private-Sphere-Democracy-Digital-Age/dp/0745645259">A Private

                        Publics: Sentiment, Technology, and Politics</a></em> (2014), she examines how the public
                display of emotion affects online and offline solidarity movements.</p>
