            </blockquote>
            <p>With the Canadian philosopher and media theorist Marshall McLuhan in mind⁠ — a man who was described as
                “the hottest academic property around” by the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> after publishing the
                <em>Gutenberg Galaxy</em> (1962) and <em>Understanding Media</em> (1964)⁠ — we can say that technology
                is not just about technology but mainly about us, the users, and the world we live in.
            </p>
            <p>Technology is key to our being as humankind and distinguishes us from the world of animals: we design our
                own tools. Or, even, as <a
                    href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/10/06/wij-hebben-geen-klauwen-en-dus-hebben-we-n-iphone-13362323-a1576272">philosopher
                    Peter Paul Verbeek explained,</a> we see humans as animals with something extra, with language or
                with reason. But the French philosopher Bernard Stiegler talks about <em>default, </em>an animal with
                something missing: We don’t have sharp claws that help us to survive, or a rock hard shell, so we need
                an add-on — fire, tools. And these tools become extensions of ourselves. From the hammer and nail, to
                the printing press, airplanes, and the internet⁠ — they all enhance our powers, share our words and
                thoughts, are our wings, our brain and memories, and our eyes.</p>
            <p>However, with the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, technology becomes more and more
                complex and leaves many of us guessing about what’s going on.</p>

            <p>This is especially poignant because technology has a formative, and at times disruptive, impact on who we
                are and what we are. In the never-ending⁠ — or might we say <em>classic⁠</em> — discussion between the
                technological determinists and the social constructivists, we are still trying to decide who is taking
                the lead in this world: we as humankind, or technology itself. Do we design and construct our tools at a
                conscious level, or are we mere pliable users of the tools we have created? Did we think, “Hell yes,
                let’s make a device that has us scrolling for hours on end to see what our exes, old classmates and
                strangers are up to!” Or did we just happen to end up at this point, wondering, “How on Earth did we get
                here?”</p>
            <p>The only chance we have to actually take control of the technologies that shape our world and to
                democratize their development is to pay attention to their course. Not just the nerds and techies should
                have a say, but we as users, citizens, artists, fans, and thinkers should also be able to chime in. A
                social construction of technology is only social if we all take part.</p>
            <p>Within the ecosystem of creative economies, festivals play the role of labs, and have an important task
                in facilitating this discussion. They are the main stage in a process of communication, providing a
                venue for the act of deciphering and decoding meaning. In this process, festivals afford a common ground
                for the exchange of ideas and reflection, and as spaces of experimentation. Through careful curation and
                contextualization, they demonstrate tangibly what new technologies are capable of, and what they might
                mean for us now and in the future.</p>
            <h3 id="2463"><strong>The curator as caretaker of the soul</strong></h3>
            <p>As Roya Rastegar explains in her essay “<a
                    href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/masque/overview/">Seeing differently: the curatorial
                    potential of film festival programming</a><em>,”</em> the original meaning of the word
                <em>curating</em> comes from the Latin word for <em>to care</em>: “In the 18th century a curate was a
                cleric, a spiritual guide responsible for the care of souls.” Today in the context of a museum or
                gallery, or indeed of a festival, the role of the curator is to present the art and the artist’s vision
                to collectors, audiences and artists, “to build the framework in which audiences see and engage with
                artworks in such a way that can resonate within broader cultural, political, and social contexts.”
            </p>
            <p>Curators not only take this role very seriously, but also approach it competitively. They carefully
                construct themes for their programs to proclaim their identity as an organization, and use this as a
                mode of distinction. They use themes to impart their vision of the possible ramifications, hairy objects
                or other contingencies in our world to come.</p>
            <h3 id="c866"><strong>Festivals exist in the sweet spot</strong></h3>
            <p>You could say that festivals are the sweet spot of the creative industries: they are the place where
                audiences can touch, feel and try new technologies, where makers meet and critics encounter works for
                the first time. Together they trace new possibilities and exchange ideas.</p>
            <p>This means that we can see festivals as labs: new technologies and their consequences are being tested
                and explored through artistic mediation. They do this in many different ways: They commission new works
                where specific technologies, tools and developers are being put together for the occasion. There are
                talks, exhibitions with films, VR, installations and performances. On several occasions festivals have
                also introduced and fostered knowledge exchange and collaborations between the artistic field and the
                commercial tech world, as we for example can read in <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/viff-immersed-and-role-of-the-film-festival-in-the-emerging-xr-ecosystem-17281827a684">Caitlin
                    Burns’ and Brian Seth Hurst’s </a>post in this issue about emerging technologies and festivals.</p>
            <p>Festivals also function as a pressure cooker for ideas. They organize workshops, masterclasses and talent
                programs where new projects are being developed: Many projects travel from festival to festival, making
                iterations on each occasion, and accordingly slowly finding a new form and mode of expression.</p>

                        Feast 2017</em></span></figure>
            <p>A good example of these kinds of developments is the work <em><a
                        href="http://www.treehuggervr.com/">Treehugger</a></em><a href="http://www.treehuggervr.com/">
                    by artist collective Marshmallow Laser Feast</a>, originally commissioned by Cinekid MediaLab
                (Amsterdam), STRP (Eindhoven), Southbank Center (London) and Migrations (North Wales). After iterations
                in each location, the work eventually won the 2017 <em>Tribeca</em> Storyscapes Award in New York.
                Treehugger is for Marshmallow Laser Feast an important step in their development as a company, both
                artistically and technically, and simultaneously raises the bar for the field at large.</p>
            <p>Besides the fact that festivals just show us beautiful stuff, amazing landscapes, and intriguing
                interactions, they also help us to get beyond the black box of technology, and to place ourselves within
                the stalemate between technological deterministic or social constructivist — or to question it
                altogether. They are flexible and can respond to fluid trends, hypes, and sentiments. They keep track of
                the industry, society and art in such a way that they make it accessible to a general audience, and at
                the same time, they show us how to live and be human in this world that we are creating and inhabiting
                together.</p>
            <p>Here is a look at how several festivals are doing so.</p>
            <p><strong>IMPAKT</strong></p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/349/1*05h644mMRIAQg0hBHjN1JQ.png"

                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="11383126495024347817"><span class="marginnote"><em>IMPAKT

                    manipulates perception in order to cause bias in experiences.</span></figure>
            <p>A good example of a festival that shows the relationship between technology and society is <a
                    href="http://impakt.nl/nl/headquarters/">IMPAKT</a>, a Utrecht-based organization and festival that
                presents critical and creative views on today’s culture in a truly interdisciplinary context.</p>
            <p>IMPAKT embraces a broad spectrum of disciplines. They trace the impact of technology, and we know today
                this is felt almost everywhere: in the arts, but also in society at large, in academia, media, science,
                journalism and politics. And they do so with as many people as possible. All through the year, the
                curators share their programme concepts with a diverse audience and invite them to respond. In this way,
                they spark and foster a discussion that goes beyond the regular festival grounds, while creating a local
                and international community of stakeholders.</p>
            <p>Another way IMPAKT keeps their flexibility is that they work with guest-curators. This year,<em>
                </em>it’s the turn of Jan Adriaans, Barbara Perea, and Marloes de Valk. Together they have developed the
                theme <em>Speculative Interfaces</em>, focusing on how the interface actually functions as an
                intermediate between us and technology. They are looking into the new opportunities that technological
                advances will present: How will we respond when the future interface is increasingly integrated into our
                bodies? Will it eventually physically merge with us? Who is controlling who? What would this mean for
                our autonomy and privacy? These kinds of questions spark a conscious reflection on one’s own perception
                of technology.</p>
            <p>This year, the festival runs from October 20 to December 1.</p>
            <p><strong>STRP</strong></p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/392/1*5C8R7P49yib9W9SIp5ooVw.png"

                        bodily sensations when gravity is defeated.</em></span></figure>
            <p><a href="https://strp.nl/">STRP</a> is is also dealing with the theme of technology and society. This
                Eindhoven based international festival, running next year from April 2–5 in Eindhoven, is known for its
                international collaborations and commissions. In the industrial Klokgebouw in Eindhoven, a former
                Philips building, they organize conferences, talks, expert sessions, workshops for kids and adults,
                concerts, and performances.</p>
            <p>The festival takes on a specifically optimistic approach towards this technology debate, and wants to
                know how we can resist the demands technology seems to make of our society. In 2019 and 2020 they do
                this with their slogan “To hell with future phobia, here’s to the future”<em> </em>Under this motto, the
                festival wants to escape the contemporary undercurrent that seems to be led by a crippling nostalgia
                about how everything was better yesterday.</p>
            <p>In this way the organizers want tododge the dystopian fantasies of future technologies by focusing on the
                humane, poetic, and soft side of technology. Technology itself is thus pushed into the background and
                the aim is to promote artistic expressiveness and social relevance.</p>
            <p>A clear expression of this attitude is the immersive installation of Teun Vonk, <em>A Sense of
                    Gravity</em>, which premiered at the festival in spring this year<em>. </em>In his work Vonk focuses
                on the human body, and how we cope with an even more technological future. His prediction is that the
                level of digitization and automation will only increase, and that the relationship between humans and
                machines, and the way we think about this, will change significantly. In <em>A Sense of Gravity,</em>
                Vonk gives the audience a chance to be released from the forces of gravity for a short moment, while
                being immersed in a one-person experience, elevated and surrounded by an unfolding spiraling shape.</p>
            <p><strong>Todays Art</strong></p>

            <p><a href="https://todaysart.nl/">TodaysArt</a> , an annual event held in September in The Hague, shows
                visually immersive art and music, performances and organizes talks. They celebrate technology in its
                digital and physical forms but also critically observe more social and political aspects. Over the past
                two years the festival has been zooming in on the concept of the algorithm hidden deep within our
                digital “parallel world”: invisible at the surface, but unavoidably steering our daily reality.</p>
            <p>This year they addressed their program through the topic of CONSCIOUSNESS, and — inspired by their
                keynote speaker Douglas Rushkoff, who warns us about platforms like Facebook (Watch out, we are not the
                users, we are used) — they focused on the role of <a href="https://teamhuman.fm/">“Team Human”</a> .</p>
            <p>At first sight, TodaysArt seems to explore mostly the new aesthetics of the digital world, and celebrates
                the crossroads of music and visual culture in a raving nightlife. However, they also talk about digital
                and high-tech cuisine, blockchain and biotechnology. And, for example, this year they also gave the
                floor to political discussions, such as the conversation between the Sea Shepherd captain, animal and
                human rights activist and author from Germany Pia Klemp and Sre<em>ć</em>ko Horvat, the Croatian
                philosopher, author and political activist, who talked about the refugee crises, globalism, and the
                alleged demise of the European dream.</p>

            <p>Another player in this technology-society discussion, also based in Eindhoven, is <a
                    href="https://2019.manifestations.nl/">Manifestations</a>, taking place this year from October
                19–27. The question that takes the lead in their programme is “<em>Will the Future Design Us?</em>”
                Creative director Viola van Alphen observes that technological innovation has a growing impact on our
                daily lives, our societies, and our humanity, and this is the main motivation for the program. Van
                Alphen expressly raises the question as to who or what all this technology ultimately is serving. Is
                everyone able to participate? Are these developments beneficial and healthy for all of us? What role do
                we actually want technology to play in our lives?</p>
            <p>For Manifestations it is the artists who are most able to put technology and unstoppable developments in
                a different, unexpected perspective. This year the theme of Manifestations is “Superpowers: moving from
                paranoia to empowerment.” They approach technology not as profit-driven solutions for the convenience of
                the individual; instead they research, play, ask, and show how technology can help to build a kinder,
                more humane world. Technology gives humanity superpowers and the sky is the limit when it comes to
                shaping our bodies, the earth, and our minds. But will we all have superpowers and super beauty, or will
                that only be for the happy few?</p>
            <p>The show this year will address a range of issues, including body enhancements, Mother Earth, being
                perfect, fear, hope, mass media, robots, e-fashion, and macho versus feminine and shows the work of
                mostly young, recently graduated artists. Next to this, there are kids’ workshops, lectures, and
                meet-ups. Manifestations focuses on “nicer, more human technology (…) innovations that everyone benefits
                from, young or old, male or female, rich or poor.”</p>

            <p>Another trend we can observe is the role film festivals play in the art, science and technology debate.
                Programs such as Sundance’s New Frontier, Tribeca’s StoryScape, Venice ‘s VR Island, and IDFA’s Doclab
                run programs dedicated to new technologies. They all show a wide range of works in which storytellers,
                creative technologists, filmmakers, and coders work together to tell different narratives.</p>
            <p>The Nederlands Film Festival, in 2019 running from September 27 - October 5— and for which I am curating
                the Interactive program — is also moving in this direction and explores themes that question the status
                of technology. This year the program is wrapped around the theme of <em>Lab Life: In Search of the
                    Miraculous. </em>This program makes space for the contemporary notion that because of the growing
                complexity of technologies, multidisciplinary teams are necessary. Co-creation and collaboration are
                shifting the focus from single authorship.</p>
            <p>Within this theme, the Nederlands Film Festival has several exhibitions, an award show for interactive
                productions, workshops and expert meetings, and adds the interactive approach into the mix of the more
                traditional film and television conference. The festival wants to raise awareness on both sides of the
                fence: they want to inspire traditional filmmakers to take note of what is happening in the interactive
                world but also the other way around. They aim at solid collaborations between the different worlds and
                intend to explore how professionals from the two fields can strengthen each other’s domains.</p>
            <p>As an example of this practice, <em>Sacred Hill,</em> an interactive VR performance about what it means
                to be human in virtual reality, has been commissioned by the festival in collaboration with <a
                    href="https://hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en">The New Institute</a>. Here the engineer Ali Eslami, the
                artist Mamali Shafahi, and designer and artist Klasien van de Zandschulp have collaborated on a work
                that investigates what it means to be human in VR.</p>
            <p>In my post next month, <em>Sacred Hill</em> will be explored in more detail.</p>
            <h3 id="5d91"><strong>How to be human</strong></h3>
            <p>Festivals with their programs, labs, themes and commissions, and the creative industries at large,
                arguably are still doing the same thing McLuhan tried to explain in his famous <em>Playboy
                </em>interview back in 1969:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em><strong>PLAYBOY</strong></em><em>: To borrow Henry Gibson’s oft-repeated one-line poem on Rowan
                        and Martin’s Laugh-In — “Marshall McLuhan, what are you doin’?”</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em><strong>McLUHAN</strong></em><em>: Sometimes I wonder. I’m making explorations. I don’t know
                        where they’re going to take me. My work is designed for the pragmatic purpose of trying to
                        understand our technological environment and its psychic and social consequences.</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>As far as I am concerned, this is still necessary and these efforts still make sense. Technology is
                pointing us again and again toward the same question: what does it mean to be human? In this
                technology-driven society, festivals are helping us to make sense of the latest tools and features. With
                their themes they frame our gaze and contextualize our experiences. They all in some ways deal with the
                reciprocal relationship between us as “team human,” technology, Mother Earth and the future. The themes
                function as a lens and is a suggestion as to how we can look at the topics, discourses, and works they
                show us. They try to make a point about our world. Or basically, what it means for us to be human in
                this world. And it gives us these common grounds to reflect on the now, premediate the future, and
                discuss its course.</p>
            <p><em>Next month’s post will be a close reading of the speculative, futuristic, performance-VR piece Sacred
                    Hill by Ali Eslami, Klasien van de Zandschulp, and Mamali Shafahi, about how to be a spiritual being
                    in a digital reality.</em></p>
