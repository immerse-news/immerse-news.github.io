            <p><em>We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the
                    tormentor, never the tormented.</em>— Elie Wiesel</p>
            <p><em>Immerse</em> stands with all who oppose President’s Trump’s misguided executive order to ban
                immigrants from seven Muslim majority countries and Syrian refugees. It is unacceptable that America
                close its doors to people based solely on their religion and country of origin. It runs contrary to our
                founding principles and to what makes America great.</p>
            <p>We believe in democratic dialogue, civility and free speech, and know that a diversity of opinions and
                perspectives is essential to drive innovation and creativity. We seek to broaden the conversation about
                new forms of immersive media, and encourage Muslim immigrants, Syrian refugees, LGBQT people,
                African-Americans, those from the the Global South and all others to be part of our discussion and
                community. We stand with you. We support you. We are ready to amplify your voice.</p>
