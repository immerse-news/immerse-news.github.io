                        href="http://makinganewreality.org"> response</a></strong></h3>
            <p>Kamal Sinclair’s <a
                    href="https://makinganewreality.org/prelude-making-a-new-reality-f78634d2c7ea">series</a> is an epic
                contribution to the field.</p>
            <p>This is an unprecedented research project synthesizing over 100 interviews, and a mother download of
                links from one of the brightest minds in the new frontier of emergent storytelling. The volume and power
                of the voices Sinclair has brought together, in harmony and often in syncopation, sounds a roaring call
                to action, because inclusion in the tech and media worlds has been systemically, historically denied.
                This report is the culmination of Sinclair’s deep work and years of singular commitment to the urgent
                issue of inclusion in all aspects of media-making, traditional and emergent.</p>
            <p>I write this as a colleague: Kamal and I are both on the editorial board of <em>Immerse</em>, and we are
                both authoring research projects for Just Films at Ford Foundation.</p>
            <p>At this early juncture of the release of Kamal’s series, I’d like to amplify two words in her report. One
                is a noun: <em>The internet</em>. The other is a verb: <em>Decolonize</em>.</p>

            <h3 id="c6bf"><strong>First, the Internet</strong></h3>
            <p>In “<a href="https://immerse.news/the-high-stakes-of-limited-inclusion-908e8f6deda0">The High Stakes of
                    Limited Inclusion</a>,” Kamal rings an alarm, citing billionaire Klaus Schwab’s (perhaps hyperbolic)
                insistence that we are in the dawn of a “fourth industrial revolution.” Sinclair also evokes a new
                geological epoch, the Anthropocene, to stress the urgency of climate change, as well as global nuclear
                build-up. Scientists argue there is a permanent mark on our geological record of distinct nuclear
                debris. These strong assertions of a new period in history are, of course, being made to assert: WE HAVE
                NO TIME TO WASTE.</p>
            <p>Within these theoretical contexts, which themselves could use critical unpacking, but not here, Kamal
                argues that the current suite of technologies — emerging media such as VR, AR, XR, AI, IoT and others —
                provides us with a unique window, for “ushering in sweeping changes that have enormous promise for
                advancing civilization.”</p>
            <p>“It is broadly acknowledged,” she writes, “that, if misused, these emerging technologies pose powerful
                threats to the goal of creating a more equitable world.”</p>
            <p>While I agree broadly that the introduction of new technologies opens a window of liminality in which art
                and social justice stand a chance, I worry whether we really are at a dawn of opportunity with this
                particular suite of technologies — many of which are already closed, proprietary, or nearly impossible
                for those with few means to access.</p>
            <p>I’m afraid that major moment of hope — arguably in our lifetime — may be passing.</p>
            <p>After all, we once collectively had similarly high aspirations for the internet. Right now, we are on the
                eve of some of the <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/technology/internet-dying-repeal-net-neutrality.html?smid=fb-share">most
                    catastrophic blows to net neutrality</a>. We are entering a profound period of the incarceration and
                (re)colonization of the World Wide Web. The emerging suite of technologies that Kamal describes are
                tethered to that foundational reality. They will not contribute to the liberation of humanity if the
                internet as we currently know it is lost.</p>
            <figure><iframe
                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2FbeBR6zRldlRg4%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FbeBR6zRldlRg4%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FbeBR6zRldlRg4%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=giphy"
                    width="435" height="435" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
            <p>One of the problems is that net neutrality seems boring. It’s about legislation, regulation,
                bureaucracies…zzzzz. It doesn’t feel revolutionary. It can’t be monetized. It’s just the hard labour of
                good governance.</p>
            <p>It’s a big load to bear, but meaningful calls for inclusion in the tech and media world first need to be
                grounded in movements defending the freedom of the internet.</p>
            <p>These are dark days for the web. Monopolies, walled gardens, surveillance and fear have spread across the
                internet. On the flip side, there is a new wave of open emerging: a grassroots movement for online
                freedom, creativity and opportunity for all,” says Mark Surman, of Mozilla Foundation, in <em><a
                        href="http://tech.newstatesman.com/guest-opinion/digital-empires">The New
                        Statesman</a></em><em>.</em></p>
            <p>And, conversely, the internet freedom movements need to do more to mindfully recognize their own
                hierarchies and to include, as Sinclair so eloquently states, “robust participation of people from a
                broad set of communities, identity groups, value systems, and fields of knowledge in this emerging media
                landscape, in all roles and levels of power.”</p>

            <p>An inspiring example in Detroit, is this <a
                    href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kz3xyz/detroit-mesh-network">digital justice
                    project</a> to build an autonomous internet. Through profoundly community-based approaches, it aims
                to close the digital divide in that city, where 40% of residents do not have internet access.</p>
            <p>As new technologies emerge, they are built on the fragile foundations of the internet as we know it —
                even if they do also provide uncharted possibilities for storytelling and also new additional sets of
                questions about who is included and who is not.</p>
            <p>Despite this, there are, of course, <a
                    href="https://medium.com/@downtohoerth/list-of-diverse-founders-in-emerging-tech-da0faedbb2b2">amazing
                    rays of hope</a>, moonbeams in the darkness.</p>
            <h3 id="9f61"><strong>The other word is DECOLONIZE.</strong></h3>
            <p>At this point in our geological trajectory, “inclusion” can’t just mean a seat at the table, in all roles
                and levels of power. It needs to come within a broader framework of decolonization. Sinclair quotes
                Heather Rae’s brilliant concept of the “decolonization of the consciousness.” It’s a necessary starting
                point, and it’s where storytelling might be at its strongest. First comes the liberation of our
                imaginations.</p>
            <p>We need to also decolonize the very entrenched systems that devise the way we run our economies, define
                what is “science,” and what technologies are even invented. To build on Kamal’s metaphor, we need to
                decolonize the entire operating system.</p>
            <p>As adrienne maree brown has written <a
                    href="https://immerse.news/this-is-the-moment-for-visionary-narratives-7db0d9797ec1">here at
                </a><em><a
                        href="https://immerse.news/this-is-the-moment-for-visionary-narratives-7db0d9797ec1">Immerse</a></em>,
                “Those who own the companies that shape our communications look like those who run the banks, military
                and government, the sheriffs and police chiefs—younger, but still white, male, concerned with
                ‘diversity’ as an afterthought or an act of benevolence, celebrating themselves as innovators. They are
                millionaires and billionaires slowly consolidating all the ways we build patterns with each other,
                accountable primarily to themselves and their investors.”</p>
            <p>History does not just run “its course,” as Gunter Ollman says and so technological advancement does not
                “veer history off its course.” The stories that are told and the history that is written (after the
                fact) is the rationalization for how the chips fell, the technologies invented, heavily to the victors’
                side.</p>
            <p>Kamal evokes a haunting fictional scene for us: Nyarru Morgan, the protagonist of <em>Collisions</em> VR
                (created by Lynette Wallworth and Nicole Newnham-Malarkey), sitting at the table with Oppenheimer, the
                inventor of the nuclear bomb, or others like him, to define how nuclear power might be used. “What if,
                instead of being blindsided by the decision to use atomic energy as a weapon, Nyarri Morgan had been one
                of the people helping to define how it was used? Perhaps by telling his ancestral stories of land
                stewardship and kinship social systems he could have pointed the way to different possibilities. What
                bugs in our operating system might have been circumvented?” asks Sinclair.</p>
            <p>Decolonization means that in another narrative, in another time, in another history, nuclear power may
                not have been invented at all. This is why we must be careful of whose truths we accept. Decolonization
                upsets the very table itself.</p>
            <p>In Canada, we’ve recently had a very powerful set of specific recommendations laid out on how to begin
                decolonization. There are <a
                    href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf">26
                    of those recommendations</a> in the monumental <em><a
                        href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=890">Truth and Reconcillation
                        Report</a></em>, which was a deep inquiry into the brutal, systemic and genocidal Residental
                school system enforced by the colonialist Canadian government on Indigenous communities, from 1870s to
                1996.</p>
            <p>And of course, there’s Buffy Sainte-Marie. On Twitter, she famously proclaimed, “Keep Calm. and
                #Decolonize.”</p>

            <p>In one of the films, <em>Flood</em>, built out of director Amanda Strong’s striking shadow puppets and
                layered media, a youth named Thunder must navigate through storms of paper and laws of colonization.
                Guided by the spider woman, she must act in resistance to let freedom rise. It’s a stunning short film.

            <p>J. Robert Oppenheimer spent the rest of his life in regret after his nuclear invention was used as a bomb
                in 1945 that immediately killed over 120,000 people, with tens of thousands later dying of exposure to
                radiation. So the image of Nyarru Morgan and Oppenheimer sitting together, discussing the threat and
                possibility of nuclear energy in the context of Martu worldview, with equal voice and power, is an image
                that has burned into my mind, and I’m grateful to Wallworth and Sinclair for it. It is a powerful symbol
                of the potential of co-creative practice: bringing divergent perspectives to come together to find new
                solutions to old, complex problems. It’s one of the central tenets of our philosophy that we are
                exploring at the emergent Co-Creation Studio at MIT’s <a
                    href="http://opendoclab.mit.edu/">OpenDocLab</a>.</p>
            <p>Whether we are in another industrial revolution (or not), whether we agree on the opportunity of current
                emerging tech (or not), whether we call it reconciliation or decolonization, the future is now. Full
                participation must happen.</p>
