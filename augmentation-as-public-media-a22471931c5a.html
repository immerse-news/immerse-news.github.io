                    Keiichi Matsuda’s short film, <em><a href="http://hyper-reality.co/">Hyper-Reality</a></em><em>
                        (2016)</em></span></figure>
            <p>Keiichi Matsuda’s 2016 <em><a href="http://hyper-reality.co/">Hyper-Reality</a></em> remains one of the
                most concise indictments of the capitalist imagination that I have seen. In this crowdfunded futuristic
                vision of augmented reality gone wild, no experience, no matter how quotidian, is safe from
                transactional logics. The streets of Matsuda’s Medellín, like its busses and grocery stores, are
                supersaturated with an information overlay, interpenetrated with commercials, and insistently driven by
                gamification.</p>
            <p>Sadly, this vision of augmentation in public spaces is alive and well in Anno 2021. A Google image search
                for “augmented reality” offers a glimpse into status quo thinking about augmented reality that largely
                replicates Matsuda’s tropes, minus the gusto. Fortunately, a counter movement has taken hold and is
                surging.</p>
            <p>A new generation of artists, activists, and documentarians has entered public space, armed with the
                possibilities of emerging technologies as well as long-established techniques for augmenting,
                documenting, confronting, and shifting our cultural narratives. From large-scale projections that draw
                attention to gentrification, to mobile apps that augment the meaning of statues and streets with
                unfamiliar stories, to location-based audio that highlights the effects of climate change, public space
                in these scenarios offers a platform for expression and transformation.</p>

                        href="https://www.instagram.com/videometry/">Dustin Klein</a> created light projections
                    targeting the Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond, VA. Klein’s collective, <a
                        href="https://www.reclaimingthemonument.com/">Reclaiming the Moment</a>, aimed to “challenge
                    dominance narratives around historic memory.” In response to controversy surrounding the statue,
                    Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam issued a state order for the memorial’s removal, and it was dismantled n
                    September 2021</span></figure>
            <p>Public spaces resonate in particularly interesting ways when overlaid with stories and images that are
                specific to them, making visible normally occluded conditions and layers of time. That, in any case, is
                our hypothesis. Indeed, thanks to a battery of augmentation technologies, public space is poised to
                serve as a robust platform for documentary and journalism, reality-engaged media that are too often
                cloistered, fire-walled, and site-agnostic. In this scenario, public space may well emerge as a platform
                for new forms of public media rather than simply morphing into the advertising industry’s next frontier.
            </p>
            <p>The triad of augmentation, public space, and reality-based media (documentary and journalism) forms the
                core of a two-year research initiative that MIT’s Open Documentary Lab and Co-Creation Studio are
                conducting together with <a href="https://www.idfa.nl/en/info/idfa-doclab-r-d-program">IDFA DocLab’s
                    Research &amp; Development Program</a>. This endeavor is as concerned with the work of individual
                practitioners, many of whose work is supported by IDFA DocLab, as it is with mapping a space of
                intervention for the larger field.</p>
            <h2 id="6124">Slippery terms</h2>
            <p>The astute reader may have noticed some slippage between ‘augmented reality’ and ‘augmentation’.
                Microsoft/Hololens and MagicLeap have spent small fortunes to convince us that augmented reality (as in
                AR) is a proprietary headset-based technology as cumbersome as present-day VR, with the difference that
                the external world peeks through. But this leaves out any number of established augmentation practices,
                from location-specific audio to phone and tablet-based systems to building-scale projection, not to
                mention analog systems (signage, for example). True, most media technologies enjoy some definitional
                imprecision (does VR include 360 video?), but when it comes to slippage, augmentation is in a league of
                its own.</p>
            <p>Who has not walked down a street, phone in hand while following a map, looking up an address, or
                attending to some urgent business? These scenarios, some location-related and some not, effectively
                augment and transform the experience of moving through space. The term augmentation literally means
                enhancement through addition, and, as the research project uses it, goes far beyond the industry’s
                narrow sense of AR to include many other approaches to annotating the world, past and present, visual
                and acoustic, digitized and not. Augmentation is a concept-in-motion, caught between the narrow needs of
                investors and the wide-ranging uses made by cultural practitioners. And, at least in this expanded
                definition, it is nearly ubiquitous, allowing it to fade into the scenery even while shaping our
                experience. This gives it significant power while making it difficult to perceive.</p>

            <h2 id="591e">The power of place</h2>
            <p>What happens when media and place combine? A tradition stretching from the caves in Lascaux and temples
                of Luxor to the latest Diller, Scofidio + Renfro creation suggests one compelling way to consider the
                question. But when it comes to screens, with the exception of drive-ins, we tend to be agnostic about
                where we consume our media. Of course, the quality of exhibition conditions matters, as does the
                character of particular venues, as does spectator habituation and preference. But the issue of where, in
                a geo-locative sense, the image takes form on screens big or handheld for the most part simply doesn’t
                matter. Screen cultures, although always local, are surprisingly ambivalent in their demands of the
                relationship between place and text.</p>
            <p>The ability to layer image and sound on particular locations enables a dialogue between text and place,
                and herein lies the great added value of augmentation for documentary and journalism. This dialogue can
                happen in a directed though non-specific manner, as in Anagram’s <em>Messages to a Post-Human
                    Earth</em>, Duncan Speakman’s <em>Only Expansion</em>, and Bart van de Woestijne’s <em>In Order of
                    Disappearance</em>. In these cases, certain attributes of a location are required (under a tree,
                near a busy street…), but those can be found in a park, a built installation, or in most urban settings.
                And sound and image can be conjoined to space in a location-specific manner, as in Halsey Burgund and
                Sue Ding’s sound installation <em>One Square Mile</em> (on the site of the Manzanar National Historical
                Site, a WW2-era internment camp for Japanese-Americans); Michel Lemieux and Victor Pilon’s
                building-scale projections of key moments in Montreal’s history, <em>Cité Mémoire</em>, in old Montreal;
                and Dustin Klein’s projections of George Floyd on the Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond, VA.</p>
            <p>Location matters in these and the many projects like them. It creates resonance with the extended world,
                both packing a punch by connecting the represented (the text) to the real (the site), and layering a
                particular spot in the world with meaning. Documentary and journalism, in this way, shift from their
                usual monolog to a dialog with the material realities on which those forms are based. And that is a
                significant and powerful shift.</p>
            <h2 id="767a">Toward a new public media?</h2>
            <p>Recent developments in augmentation technologies have prompted growing interest in public space as a
                platform for digital storytelling, providing opportunities to make visible the invisible and reframe the
                way we imagine our communities. Precisely because they are dialogic, these developments offer an
                opportunity to reconsider and expand the ranks of who annotates public spaces. And they call to mind a
                deeper history of augmentation and urban annotation, from commemorative plaques and projections to
                shadow dancing and graffiti, that can inform our thinking about the latest augmentation technologies.
            </p>
            <p>How can artists, storytellers, and cultural institutions co-create with their communities and foster
                dialogue about their public spaces, augmenting people’s experiences and in the process making public
                spaces more equitable? How can we make our public memorialization processes more reflective of diverse
                communities and more democratic? How can we use augmentation technologies to reveal artifacts and
                cultures that have been/are in the process of being erased?</p>
            <p>Lots of questions, but that’s the nature of a research agenda. The <a
