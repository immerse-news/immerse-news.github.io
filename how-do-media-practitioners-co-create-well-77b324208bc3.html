            <h3 id="995c">Risks and lessons from the Collective Wisdom field study</h3>
            <p><em>Co-creation is greater than the sum of its parts. There may be a complex set of problems that people
                    want to address together. Eventually, there will be outcomes, but these emerge out of the process
                    rather than the other way around.</em></p>
            <p><em>From our in-depth interviews, we surfaced practical takeaways for the process of co-creation. In this
                    edited excerpt from </em><a
                    href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-2">Collective Wisdom</a><em>, we
                    present some of our key findings in the forms of risks and lessons.</em></p>
            <h2 id="8519">SIX RISKS OF CO-CREATION</h2>
            <h3 id="d0ca">1. Threat to Vision and Editorial Integrity</h3>
            <p>The co-creative hope may be to flatten hierarchies and generate equity. However the “<a
                    href="https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm">Tyranny of Structurelessness</a>” can take over,
                as American activist and political scientist Jo Freeman famously described. A nameless, undefined
                hierarchy may emerge, which can be even harder to hold accountable.</p>
            <p>From an artistic perspective, “the risks are totally incoherent narratives,” said Jennifer MacArthur, a
                documentary producer. She believes that results can become so generalized and non-specific that they are
                “outside of anybody’s shared experience or understanding.”</p>

                    type="checkbox" id="15369783984611681826"><span class="marginnote">A panel on “The Art of

            <h3 id="ce32">2. Heightened Expectations</h3>
            <p>The promise of co-creation can heighten expectations of trust, commitment, responsibility, and duration
                of co-created projects. However, not everyone can commit equally to projects. The sharing of resources,
                time, credit, and responsibility of a project all need to be examined and negotiated in complex ways.
            </p>
            <h3 id="d9fa">3. Marginalizing Co-Created Projects</h3>
            <p>As Anita Lee, an executive producer at the National Film Board of Canada, says: “Artists of color have
                historically been relegated to “community media.” They have carried a double burden of both representing
                a community and also of being made responsible to make work about a community. Often this work has also
                been undervalued as having less artistic merit. Today’s progress means a new generation of artists of
                color that have more opportunities to create work about anything. Single-authorship has often been
                denied — even stolen. Does it make sense to forgo authorship now?”</p>
            <h3 id="696c">4. Unintended Consequences</h3>
            <p>Co-creative projects open to public participation can be hacked from the outside. The use of bots and
                other software can intensify the risk familiar to anyone online. This includes reader comments on news
                sites and social media, where trolls and organized opposition can drive away productive dialogue.</p>

                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="7524788594788008312">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="7524788594788008312"><span class="marginnote">“Queering
                    the Map” landing page</span></figure>
            <p><em>Queering the Map</em> (2018) is a project that Lucas LaRochelle created to gather queer stories from
                around the world on a virtual map. It went viral almost immediately after its first media exposure. Just
                as quickly, the map was attacked by a bot.</p>
            <h3 id="06cd">5. Theft and Exploitation</h3>
            <p>There is reason to be suspicious at the way co-creation has come into vogue as a concept, coinciding with
                dramatic shifts in digital-age economics. Through Uber, Mechanical Turk, Facebook, and fandoms, millions
                of people are lending their ideas, content, and labor to highly centralized profiteers. Participatory
                designer Sasha Costanza-Chock warned of media projects where all the “credit, visibility, awards, all
                end up just accruing to one person but then you call it co-creation so it gets this stamp of democratic
                legitimacy.”</p>
            <h3 id="0bfb">6. The Risk of Co-optation</h3>
            <p>As the term <em>co-creation</em> circulates into popular usage, it could fall victim to shiny-new-word
                syndrome and get trapped in the rapid cycle of co-optation. Co-creation could be sucked up into the
                vortex of digital empires.</p>
            <h2 id="9e7e">THREE PRACTICAL LESSONS FOR CO-CREATING</h2>
            <h3 id="18ab">1. Gathering, Listening, Dialogue</h3>
            <p>Co-creative projects begin with relationships. They start by creating a space where people may gather and
                ask questions. They require a serious commitment to iteration and change along the way. Too often,
                members of projects stop the listening portion after the first round, and later, the approach is reduced
                to a one-time consultation or data-mining by those in control. But that is where the problems set in and
                co-creation ends. With a genuinely co-creative approach, these initial steps are only the first
                term-setting conversations, not the last.</p>

                    Project” is an interactive documentary co-created with local community organizations and Indigenous
                    Peruvian women to document stories of forced sterilization under Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
                    in the 1990s. The result is a participatory oral-history project that culminates in a call to
                    action. Photo courtesy of María Court and Rosemarie Lerner.</span></figure>
            <h3 id="9855">2. Manifestos and Statements of Principles</h3>
            <p>Manifestos are declarations of the ethics, principles, and values of groups that push new ideas. <a
                    href="https://alliedmedia.org/about/network-principles">Allied Media Projects</a>, Data for
                Democracy, and <a href="https://platform.coop/about/vision-and-advantages/">Platform Cooperativism</a>
                are only a few of the dozens of organizations that have published sets of common values that define and
                guide their work.</p>
            <p>Helen Haig-Brown and Gwaai Edenshaw co-directed <em>Edge of the Knife</em> (2018) through a community-led
                process, working with existing Haida governance structures. The first thing the co-creators did was draw
                up a list of agreed-upon goals and values. They found that the highest priority item was authenticity.
                This gave the group an imperative to represent Haida culture authentically, always in close consultation
                with elders.</p>
            <h3 id="1edb">3. Contracts and Terms of Engagement</h3>
            <p>Many co-creators have identified the need for instruments that move beyond consent forms by guaranteeing
                rights and responsibilities to entire communities. In 2009, Screen Australia, a federal media agency,
                published an influential document called <em><a
                        href="https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/about-us/doing-business-with-us/indigenous-content/indigenous-protocols">Pathways
                        and Protocols: A Filmmaker’s Guide to Working with Indigenous People, Culture and
                        Concepts</a></em>. Therein, Indigenous writer and lawyer Terri Clarke offers “advice about the
                ethical and legal issues involved in transferring Indigenous cultural material to the screen.”</p>
            <p>Ellen Schneider of Active Voice has been developing customized tools called “<a
                    href="https://www.activevoice.net/prenups/home/">Pre-Nups for Partners</a>.” For over a decade,
                she’s been working with funders, filmmakers, and nonprofits to navigate the increasingly complex nuances
                of co-creative partnerships that go beyond the mold of conventional filmmaking.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, cultural groups are exploring Cultural Community Benefits Agreements (CBAs), that spell out
                the terms of engagement, especially for outside organizations coming in to work with local groups. These
                cultural agreements pick up on the model of CBAs that have become common in urban contexts to negotiate
                terms for local communities when developers arrive to transform neighborhoods.</p>
            <p>Community-benefit agreements and contracts are not panaceas. Veterans of co-creation are acutely aware of
                their pitfalls and problems but do use them to guarantee certain basic rights, alongside bigger policy
                and legislative concerns affecting the role of government. This includes how we define and use public
                space, the commons, and how we will govern ourselves and shared resources into the future.</p>
