            <p>Deep learning is about to become a part of every developer and interactive storyteller’s tool box. It’s
                not just for machine learning experts anymore. This is a compilation of software that aims to make
                complicated problems accessible to anyone with basic <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>
                scripting abilities.</p>
            <p>With any of the suggestions below, it is possible to discover the complex ideas and building blocks of
                deep learning and machine learning technology. In order to create impactful and critical experiences in
                the era of cognitive computing, it is our responsibility to uncover the hidden layers of bias and logic
                hardwired in by coders as they create AI algorithms. We can inspect the training sets and reveal that AI
                models are shaping our everyday lives. This will not only lead to a better understanding of how we
                communicate with machines but will diversify the voices that manufacture our reality.</p>
            <p>Remember: If you create your own app and intelligent platform, make sure to check for your blind spots
                and biases, <a href="https://www.ajlunited.org/">inspired by this project</a>.</p>

            <p>This free and open-source software allows you to build interactive systems based on human actions and
                gestures instead of programming code. It’s listening software that recognizes movements and composes
                visual and audio outputs, using regression, classification, and other supervised analysis models. <a
                    href="http://www.wekinator.org/">Wekinator</a> operates like a switchboard — it lives between
                different sources of input and output that use the open sound control protocol, making it easier to
                create complex relationships between someone’s movements and sounds in a creative, independent, and
                nonlinear way.</p>

                    Google</strong></h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> is an open-source software library for building
                models and training infrastructures using a front-end application. It provides a straightforward way for
                users to train computers to perform complex tasks by feeding them large amounts of data. This software
                comes with the ability to implement and integrate ML models and simulated “deep learning” neural
                networks. It also has a <em>“playground area”</em> for interactive learning about how neural networks
                work. Although TensorFlow supports low-level programming interfaces with graphic visualizations
                abilities, you need to have the basic Python or C++ programming knowledge in order to inspect and tweak
                your model and training sets. But once you dive in, you’ll discover that this software can read from any
                Python generator and complex network with a direct and accessible approach. Here are <a
                    href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/search?q=tensorflow">examples </a>of creative projects made
                with TensorFlow.</p>

            <p><a href="https://console.bluemix.net/developer/watson/documentation">IBM Cloud </a>is an open-source
                implementation of IBM Watson’s Open Cloud Architecture services. Its technology can analyze high-level
                concepts of abstraction and data which aren’t directly referenced in the input. Even with basic
                programming knowledge of Python and C++ you can access data, training sets, and build complex cognitive
                computing models through a variety of APIs to create an application. The services include Personality
                Insights, Natural Language Understanding, Visual Recognition, and several customization capabilities.
                Here are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/artwithwatson/">examples</a> of creative projects made with

            <p><a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html">Scikit-Learn</a> is an open-source Python library
                that is relatively accessible, simple, and efficient. The library is focused on modeling, analyzing, and
