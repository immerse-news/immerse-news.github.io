            <h2 id="765e">How VR is Becoming an Essential Tool for Arts Organisations</h2>
            <h3 id="d7a6">A few of the projects and approaches that use virtual reality to transform the way we
                experience classic works of art—and create new ones.</h3>
            <p>Virtual reality may well be going mainstream, but there is still a dearth of content. This is partly due
                to the unavoidable cost of creating it for 360-degree consumption, in contrast with the more controlled
                field of view offered by TV, tablet, or even theatre. But more importantly, content producers are still
                learning which curatorial approaches and modes of interaction best suit the medium.</p>
            <p>Over the past 18 months, there have been some fascinating experiments in the arts and culture sector and
                I have selected the following examples for their quality and diversity of execution. Beyond being great
                individual experiences that prove the hype, together they hint at the patterns defining how the sector
                will continue to evolve.</p>

            <p>Faced with the challenges of transporting large scale works, Michel Draguet, Director General of Musées
                royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique, wanted a safe, more affordable way to bring his Renaissance artwork
                to a wider audience. Institutions from Brussels, Budapest, Berlin, and more coordinated with Google
                Cultural Institute to demonstrate how 360 video could do just that.</p>

            <p>The launch of Google’s Tilt Brush on HTC Vive was a landmark moment in what felt like the birth of a new
                medium; art could be experienced in full 3D, completely enveloping the viewer. The Royal Academy was
                quick off the mark to involve the wider public, using off-the-shelf software to populate a dedicated
                exhibition, “Virtually Real.”</p>

            <p>A project made possible by the power of the technology, here every Van Gogh Sunflower painting is
                reunited in a single gallery, narrated by the great-grandson of Van Gogh’s brother Theo. No less than
                five institutions teamed up to reunite these paintings: London’s National Gallery, the Philadelphia
                Museum of Art, Neue Pinakothek in Munich, the Seiji Togo Memorial Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Museum of Art in
                Tokyo, and, of course, the Van Gogh Museum.</p>

            <h2 id="7362"><strong>Modigliani VR: The Ochre Atelier, November 2017</strong></h2>
            <p>One of the first of its kind, initially only accessible in a dedicated gallery space midway through
                Tate’s blockbuster retrospective. Visitors are transported to Modigliani’s 1919 Parisian studio,
                beautifully recreated in painstaking detail and all the more impressive given this studio has never been
                visited by anyone alive today.</p>
            <p>Phil Stuart, creative director on the project, explains the approach: “Understanding art is about
                understanding the painter, the paintings and also the social and historical context. The opportunity
                with virtual reality and with this project is to try and deliver that in a very short experience that
                really gets you closer to those details.” Hilary Knight Knight, Head of Digital Content at Tate, adds,
                “You get that gut-feel understanding you don’t necessarily get from reading or looking at 2D pictures.”

            </ul>
            <p>The evolving affordances of VR technology will continue to affect how the medium is used, but of more
                interest is <em>why</em> institutions and artists are using it. Over the last 18 months, three common
                themes have emerged, with a trend towards ever deeper immersion.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Into the gallery</strong> — as one of the most widely accessible and low-cost formats,
                    virtual tours are booming: <a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/ai-weiwei-360">Ai
                        Weiwei 360</a>, <a

                        Gallery 360</a>, <a href="https://www.framestore.com/work/saam-vr">Smithsonian American Art
                        Museum</a> and <a
                        href="https://www.virtualiteach.com/single-post/2017/08/20/10-amazing-virtual-museum-tours">more</a>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Into the artwork</strong> — Animating existing artworks or creating new work exclusively for
                    VR is technically more challenging but increasingly common. For example, <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKh3MifPEe0">Yinka Shonibare</a>, <a
                        href="http://anishkapoor.com/5113/into-yourself-fall">Anish Kapoor</a> and <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6uDOC8u03s">Marina Abramović</a></li>
                <li><strong>Into the artist’s world</strong> — an emerging, creatively challenging approach that
                    combines storytelling or gameplay to convey the emotions, motivations and deeper social/historical
                    context. For example, <a href="https://www.bdh.net/immersive/magritte-vr">Magritte VR</a> and <a
                        href="http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/modigliani/modigliani-vr-ochre-atelier">Modigliani
                        VR</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As the capacity for deeper immersion increases, is it unreasonable to expect a future where the emotions
                and sensations of an artist can be piped directly into our brains? Throw in some haptic feedback and we
                may soon feel what Van Gogh felt in his famous moment of self-harm, or the joy of an incapacitated
                Matisse wielding his scissors with new-found flair.</p>
            <p>That future may be some way off, but the industry has clearly learned to walk; how exciting to speculate
                what happens when it learns to run.</p>
