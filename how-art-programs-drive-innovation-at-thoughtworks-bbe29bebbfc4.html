        <section>
            <p>Artists working with emerging technologies frequently generate new insights on the future of culture,
                industry, and society. At ThoughtWorks we regularly engage with artists, collaborating on cutting edge
                technology projects, and enriching the perspectives we bring to our clients.</p>

            <p>Our recent explorations have taken us on journeys into cyborgism and transhumanism, bias in machine
                intelligence, movement in robotics, and more.</p>
            <p>This is the second article in a series exploring the symbiosis of art and technology. The <a
                    href="https://medium.com/@microcosm/how-artists-are-reshaping-emerging-technology-research-cb1b99189760">first
                    article examines how and why</a> this particular combination generates such powerful outcomes.
                Building forwards, this article explains how ThoughtWorks has created a suite of programs to harness
                this intersection by supporting artists for the benefit of our employees, partners, communities, and
                clients.</p>
            <h2 id="c00a">The suite of programs</h2>
            <p>We refer to these initiatives collectively under the umbrella of <em>ThoughtWorks Arts</em>. This
                encompasses three programs, anchored in our New York office but with global reach: the <a
                    href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/">ThoughtWorks Arts Residency</a>, <a
                    href="https://artahack.io/">Art-A-Hack</a> and <a href="https://hardwarehacklab.io/">Hardware Hack
                    Lab</a>.</p>

            <p>ThoughtWorks Arts drives innovation by creating facilitated frameworks and contexts in which art can
                collide with commercial technology development.</p>
            <p>The formation of ThoughtWorks Arts has been organic, with each program reinforcing its predecessors and
                building on successes. These programs are outlined, along with my personal journey, in the TEDx talk “<a
                    href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/presenting-our-work-tedx/">How art &amp; technology predict
                    the future</a>,” recorded in Vilnius, Lithuania, in 2017.</p>
            <p>Today, ThoughtWorks Arts is co-directed by myself, <a
                    href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/bio/andrew-mcwilliams/">Andrew McWilliams</a>, and the artist and
                Fulbright World Learning Specialist <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/bio/ellen-pearlman/">Dr. Ellen
                    Pearlman</a>. However, the journey began in the summer of 2013, instigated by a chance meeting
                between myself and fellow ThoughtWorks employee Kent Rahman.</p>
            <h2 id="6b1d">#1. The weekly demo and exchange lab</h2>
            <p>Discovering a mutual love of emerging tech, Kent and I decided to start meeting on a weekly basis to
                share knowledge of hardware innovation. We invited other ThoughtWorks co-workers to join us, and soon
                extended the invitation out publicly, naming the program <em>Hardware Hack Lab</em>.</p>
            <p>Hardware Hack Lab became a regular open-ended meeting space and demo exchange, where creative
                technologists of all backgrounds meet and share their projects and interests. The project runs every
                Wednesday evening, and continues to this day.</p>

                    Lab</span></figure>
            <p>The technology explored during these sessions ranges from microcontrollers and circuit-building through
                sensors and displays, to virtual and augmented reality. Members bring in prototypes and
                works-in-progress to develop and share. Others come to look over shoulders and get a handle on what’s
                happening around them.</p>
            <p>The lab is run in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/volumetric/">Volumetric
                    Society</a>, a group with over 3,000 members exploring the intersection of emerging technology and
                creative practice. This widens the network of technologies, skillsets, issues, and ideas that
                participants experience and exchange in each session.</p>

            <p>Among the earliest members of the Hardware Hack Lab were Joel Murphy and Conor Russomanno, founders of
                the open source Brain Computer Interface technology <a href="http://openbci.com/">OpenBCI</a>.</p>
            <p>OpenBCI enables its users to access a wide array of real-time electrical signals representing human
                mental activity via electrodes placed on the skull. Keeping the system free supports researchers,
                engineers, artists, scientists, designers, and others to use what was previously a more esoteric
                technology.</p>

                    at ThoughtWorks</span></figure>
            <p>We hosted an OpenBCI hackathon, helping raise over $215,000 to build out the initial release of the
                OpenBCI system for the community.</p>
            <p>Innovations from the lab have impacted ThoughtWorks clients. My work on <a
                    href="https://github.com/microcosm/fruitygate-nrf">bluetooth mesh networks</a>, for example, fed
                into a project in which we <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/clients/c4-media-qcon">installed
                    physical “like” buttons</a> at InfoQ conferences. The battery-powered buttons are capable of being
                infinitely extended in a self-healing mesh network, with a central device controlling access to the
                internet for permanent data storage in the cloud.</p>
            <p>With the Hardware Hack Lab running every week of the year, we are regularly generating idea-sharing and
                co-working opportunities, which help our clients innovate. To build on this, we created a program to
                incubate teams of collaborators in dynamic summer workshops.</p>
            <h2 id="7ca2">#2. The wide-reaching co-creation experiment</h2>
            <p>Through the weekly Hardware Hack Lab, ThoughtWorks saw the value of enabling open social exchange between
                a wide range of practitioners. In 2014, ThoughtWorks Arts launched its second program, Art-A-Hack.</p>
            <p>Art-A-Hack curates and facilitates the creation of prototypes via team-based art practice. We ‘collide’
                professionals of varied backgrounds into teams, enabling collaboration between people who otherwise
                might not have the opportunity to work together.</p>
            <p>We then curate projects and incubate teams in the development of a prototype or other exhibitable
                outcome.</p>

                    2016</span></figure>
            <p>Each season we publish an Open Call, asking applicants to list their skills, backgrounds, and any project
                proposals they may have. Based on the submissions, we build teams around the strongest ideas that can be
                achieved given the resources, skill sets, and time available. In an average season we might support 30
                participants over eight or nine teams, working to bring their ideas into reality.</p>
            <p>Our partnerships with institutions such as Microsoft, NYU Tandon School of Engineering, the Metropolitan
                Museum Media Lab, the Human Impacts Institute, and CyberFest help infuse the program with a wide array
                of influences. The program is also popular with ThoughtWorks employees, who regularly lead or support
                teams.</p>
            <p>Many projects we support often spur highly successful ongoing projects. In 2016 we <a
                    href="https://artahack.io/projects/hamlet-vr/">incubated the initial prototype</a> of <em>To Be With
                    Hamlet</em>, the world’s first live-time telepresence production of Shakespeare in virtual reality.
                The project then premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017.</p>

                        VR, and (inset) the team</strong></span></figure>
            <p>In addition to this, ThoughtWorks employees have worked on <a
                    href="https://artahack.io/projects/afro-futuristic-carnival/">multiple</a> <a
                    href="https://artahack.io/projects/superficial-substantive/">VR</a> <a
                    href="https://artahack.io/projects/oculus-fiber/">projects</a> during Art-A-Hack, learning new
                skills and investigating new technical domains.</p>
            <p>Using OpenBCI’s hardware, the Dual Brains team <a
                    href="https://artahack.io/projects/dual-brains/">explored human empathy via touch</a>, projecting
                their brainwaves in live performances. ThoughtWorks employee Julien Deswaef <a
                    href="https://github.com/thoughtworksarts/Dual_Brains">developed this codebase</a> for our recent
                exhibition at New York’s <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/spring-break/">SPRING/BREAK art fair</a>,
                as part of Armory Week in 2018.</p>
            <p>This kind of cross-pollination demonstrates the reinforcing effect of maintaining a suite of related
                initiatives. Communities, individuals, and ideas flow from one program to another, often producing
                surprising results.</p>
            <p>With many and varied participants in short and impactful collaborations, Art-A-Hack bubbles with energy,
                producing prototypes and insights in multiple domains each season. To build on this program, we created
                an arts residency, which fosters deep and sustained collaborations between artists and our employees.
            </p>
            <h2 id="ea63">#3. The in-depth incubator exploring tech and society</h2>
            <p>The success and popularity of the first two ThoughtWorks Arts programs set the stage for a new initiative
                to take on deeper research. Where Art-A-Hack incubates large numbers of teams on initial prototypes, the
                ThoughtWorks Arts Residency incubates individual artists with provocative and complex ideas.</p>
            <p>The residency was launched in 2016 with a mission to support artists investigating new technologies and
                considering their implications for society. Residents are provided a workspace, stipend, active support
                and incubation, and access to the global network of tech sector employees at ThoughtWorks, lasting
                anywhere from 3–6 months.</p>

            <p>Each residency invites artists to apply given a particular theme. So far we have worked with artists to
                explore issues including <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/projects/time-sense/">transhumanism</a>
                and <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/projects/seismic-sense/">cyborgism</a>, <a
                    href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/projects/suppressed-images/">genetic data privacy</a>, <a
                    href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/projects/biofields/">biometrics in virtual reality</a>, the <a
                    href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/projects/riot">biases of AI</a> and <a

                    in robotics</a>.</p>
            <p>With each artist we actively promote connections between residents and ThoughtWorks employees. This may
                result in the formation of a global project team of analysts, developers, project managers and
                designers, or it may result in a very direct collaboration between the artist and a single employee.
                Each project works out differently depending on its unique characteristics.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I feel proud when explaining to clients our incubation of art and emerging technology projects. When
                    one client in the automotive industry discovered the Cyborg Foundation artists, they were inspired
                    to learn about how ThoughtWorks collaborated with the artists to produce new prototypes.

            <p>The ThoughtWorks Arts Residency is the most recent addition to this suite of creative programs at
                ThoughtWorks. Using art practice and community engagement as framing principals, the three programs are
                calibrated to achieve depth, breadth, and consistency of innovation.</p>
            <h2 id="ca65">Art’s role within ThoughtWorks culture</h2>

            <p>The increasing pace of technological change means that our clients are always looking for ways to rapidly
                innovate and lead their respective fields, and they are looking for varied sources of inspiration and
                technical knowledge.</p>
            <p>Our work in ThoughtWorks Arts feeds into ThoughtWorks’ views on emerging technology landscapes,
                contributing first-hand experiences of new technical realities and broadening dialog among employees.
                These programs support our aim of technical excellence in new fields and expand our ability to support
                clients.</p>
            <p>Further, the continued expansion of ThoughtWorks Arts’ partner network continually injects fresh
                viewpoints into our internal and external discourse.</p>

            <p>At ThoughtWorks we are committed to our <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/social-justice">pillar of
                    social justice</a>. We continue to engage with progressive individuals and organizations, allowing
                employees to contribute their skills. ThoughtWorks Arts reinforces this arrangement, with employees
                contributing their skills to exploration of new and unexpected social impacts of emerging technologies.
            </p>
            <p>All of this goes to the heart of ThoughtWorks culture, in which we <a
                    href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/about-us">value our technical excellence</a> as much as we aim
                for positive social impact in the world.</p>
            <p>The next articles in this series will examine some of our projects in more detail. I will explain how
                these projects were formulated and what they have achieved. I will also look more deeply at the value
                generated by these explorations at the intersection of art and commercial technology development.</p>
