            <p>For this issue, the MIT Open Documentary Lab curated a Docubase playlist of projects that uniquely
                capture themes of social confinement and isolation through new media techniques and technologies.
                Isolation is on all of our minds as we live through a pandemic—but nothing we experience outside prison
                walls compares to confinement within a prison, where rights to privacy, respect, and autonomy are taken
                away.</p>
            <p>The playlist, <a href="https://docubase.mit.edu/playlist/confinement/">Confinement,</a> includes XR
                projects that use 3D imagery to express the physicality of a solitary confinement cell, first-person
                narratives to intimately share stories of formerly incarcerated people, and data visualizations to
                demonstrate the sheer scale of mass incarceration in the U.S. These projects also explore topics ranging
                from the immigration detention process, to re-entering a society that is unprepared to take care of
                those leaving the prison system. We researched productions featured in leading festivals, conferences,
                <em>Immerse,</em> and Docubase itself.

            <p>Docubase is a curated database of the people, projects, and technologies transforming documentary in the
                digital age. It is a place to discover various playlists and projects, unearth new work, explore
                techniques, and find people pioneering storytelling forms. Docubase opens up the digital storytelling
                process by providing production data about each project, behind-the-scenes materials, interviews, and
                case studies to demystify the process and encourage participation.​</p>
            <p>The public is invited to participate and learn from this growing community of digital documentary makers:
                Comment, suggest a project or a tag, or write your own playlist.​</p>
