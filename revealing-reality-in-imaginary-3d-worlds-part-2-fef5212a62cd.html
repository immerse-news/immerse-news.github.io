                <p>A city on water with floating buildings, bridges and gondolas, and canals for thoroughfares, it’s
                    fitting that Venice is home to Venice Immersive, a magnificent display of 3D worlds explored through
                    VR headsets. In VR, you find yourself transported to a colorful array of worlds, from animated
                    Ancient Egyptian tombs to fantasy worlds like Gumball Lounge. By yourself or with others, your job
                    is to explore these worlds and <strong><a
                            href="https://immerse.news/finding-the-story-user-experiences-of-immersive-media-at-idfas-doclab-ff5409bb7558">find</a></strong>
                    the stories. Some worlds are completely fantastical while others are simulated real worlds created
                    using data capture techniques such as photogrammetry or lidar scanning. All are created in game
                    engines and use a conglomeration of languages and grammars from video games, immersive theater,
                    documentary, film, dance and/or architecture among others.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>At this year’s festival, one could see new languages and grammars bubbling up at the intersection of
                    these fields. Using real time 3D game engines, stories move forward with techniques such as treasure
                    hunts, live actors and virtual scenes mapped onto physical sets that participants wander through;
                    the scene changing depending on where the participant moves their hands and eyes. Documentaries at
                    Venice Immersive ranged from the photo real to real time 3D animations.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I sat down with two artists who created imaginary worlds and characters to engage audiences with
                    pressing real world issues. Participants had to discover the non-fiction content by making their way
                    through the world and learning its language. What follows is part two of a three-part series
                    highlighting each of these artists and the worlds they built.</p>

            <h3 id="e4fb"><em><strong>All Unsaved Progress Will Be Lost </strong></em><strong>(2022) by Melanie
                    Courtinat</strong></h3>
            <p>Melanie Courtinat, an artistic director for brands by day and an immersive artist by night, is a creative
                particularly drawn to horror and themes of loss. She shares, <strong>“Every artist has their obsessions.
                    I really think that melancholy [and] loneliness are themes that speak to me.”</strong></p>
            <p>With works such as <em>I Never Promised You a Garden (2017) </em>and <em>Trouble</em> (2022), Courtinat
                creates speculative and virtual worlds using VR/AR and game engines and likes to experiment with and
                push the boundaries of these technologies’ expressive capabilities.</p>
            <p>One of her experiments, <em>All Unsaved Progress Will Be Los</em>t, premiered at Venice Immersive in
                September 2022. She created the virtual reality project in a few weeks by herself with no funds. The
                project tells the story of an unknown narrator who refuses to evacuate their hometown after an
                environmental catastrophe. The story unfolds through text that appears around you as the experience
                propels you forward through a landscape that is at once beautiful and stark. Haunting music plays in the
                background, and the world that she creates is a ghost town. The few animals you see are silent. Based on
                a true event, all of the text is taken from an archive of interviews with people who experienced an
                environmental disaster in their village and presented as one narrator’s story. In the spirit of allowing
                audience members to experience the story with their own eyes, the artist asked that the focus of the
                archive not be revealed in this article.</p>
            <p><strong>“The story is based on real-life events, but I imagined this character. There’s no information
                    about their gender in the story, but for me it’s an old woman. She’s made of thousands of pieces of
                    text, of different testimonies…</strong> <strong>I didn’t want it to have actual characters. I think
                    it was interesting for me, for the spectator, to be able to project… In the beginning, the narrator
                    is talking about the threat of poison in the air and water that humans cannot see, and some people
                    interpret this as a monster or an alien, and I really like them to keep guessing and keep
                    confronting themselves with their own personal fears. And then, in the end, finding out that it
                    actually happened.”</strong></p>
            <p>As you move through, your eyes follow written quotes that appear sentence by sentence, originating from
                but not narrated by the woman of the village. The words hover in the foggy sky over the grass, as do a
                few flowers and animals below you. In front of you, a big cement structure looms. The stark landscape
                and simple texts makes the experience feel eerie and ominous. Behind you, you see the trail of texts
                that you read, hanging on in the heavy air like the player character hangs on to her home knowing that
                all will be eventually lost — her home, her village, her life. Although the world Courtinat created is
                minimalist, it’s evocative.</p>
            <p>“<strong>It wasn’t a project created because of the story. The story came second. It first came with the
                    sentiment, the emotion.”</strong></p>
            <p>The emotion is one of fear and loss. I imagined what it would be like if someone knocked on my door and
                told me to leave immediately — how I would feel abandoning my home. Or how I would feel if I stayed
                knowing that toxins surrounded me and eventually would kill everything in their wake. I felt for this
                woman who refused to go, the pain of loss too great to bear, the anger keeping her there.</p>
            <p>During the pandemic, Courtinat started to read voraciously and eventually stumbled upon a book of
                interviews buried in her book shelf that her mother gave her when she was a teenager, about a
                catastrophic event that destroyed people’s lives. It deeply disturbed and stuck with her years later, as
                she started crafting a VR experience based on the book. As an avid gamer, she approached the adaptation
                as a game designer rather than a documentarian.</p>
            <p><strong>“I don’t think in terms of frames, like, you have a little character here and then something big
                    on the left. I don’t know much about it. My personal background is in video games, so I’ve always
                    created worlds thinking in 360 degrees. So when you use a game engine to create, it’s like doing
                    little models. You’re going to do the terrain first, make it uneven and then you’re going to paint
                    your rock or grass textures. And then you’re going to put a little tree here and place everything
                    you want. Then you’re going to light it and perhaps add fog, I personally like it heavy. And only in
                    the end, . . . I will go to first person mode and wander in this world I just created and find the
                    perfect point of view. And I will place the camera here. And that’s the way of creating that I
                    really like. It’s super fun, to be honest.</strong></p>
            <p>The title for this piece additionally comes from an in-game statement that appeared when she started
                playing games in her youth. She elaborates further:</p>
            <p><strong>The title </strong><em>All Unsaved Progress Will Be Lost</em> is like a sentence you could read
                when you were playing video games, like in my first RPGs (Role Playing Games) … At this time, the
                gameplay mechanism of saving the game wasn’t as immediate as nowadays. You really had to go to some
                specific place, manually save it, and then you had this kind of message, “Are you sure you want to quit?
                All unsaved progress would be lost.” It’s such a weird sentence if you think about it. It’s so bizarrely
                grave and intense in a misplaced moment. You’re just having fun thinking about nothing else and just
                enjoying the game. And so, reading this sentence would strike me and make me feel a very unique, very
                peculiar emotion of losing something safe. And to be honest, this project was created because I was
                wanting to give the spectator this exact feeling of a “lost heaven.” <em>Paradis perdu</em><strong> we
                    say in French.</strong></p>
            <p>Since first introduced to creating in VR, Courtinat has been hooked, with <em>All Unsaved Progress Will
                    Be Lost</em> being one, but certainly not the last, of her triumphs in emergent tech. Reflecting on
                her own creative process in this medium, she loves the feeling of being in another world and the
                “intuitive” feeling of using game engines to tell stories. She thought, “Okay, this is what I want to
                do.<strong>” </strong>And ever since, she has been creating virtual worlds and augmented experiences
                that haunt, provoke and draw attention to what can be lost.</p>
