            <h2 id="164e">My background</h2>
            <p>I was paralyzed from the waist down in high school, from a ski accident in 2010. Although I no longer had
                any motion from the waist down, the accident did nothing to diminish my zest for travel. I have
                frequently traveled between South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, China, Japan and many more places after my
                accident.</p>
            <p>Before going to college in the US, I took a year off to start a non-profit organization to assist
                disabled students traveling around Seoul, South Korea. Not many able-bodied people know the details that
                are involved in wheelchair travel. I only knew about this whole new world after I got injured. This is
                why I still think being in a wheelchair really opened my eyes to a big part of the world that is easily
                forgotten. This is why I decided to dedicate my time to empower people like me, which has been on my
                mind ever since the injury.</p>

            <p>The summer after freshman year of college, I rented a van with three friends and planned a road trip to
                visit 20 cities in the US, documenting the wheelchair accessible restaurants, hotels and attractions to
                create the <em><a href="http://20statesonwheels.com">20 States on Wheels </a></em>travel guide. This was
                a rather ambitious project, as none of us had any experience in writing or publishing a book. We failed
                a lot, but we managed to publish a book combining personal stories, accessibility info for popular
                sites, and tips on things like using disability car placards across state lines. Without my friends, the
                book would not exist. This is when I first experienced the power of co-creation.</p>

            <h2 id="72ff">The Saigon Project</h2>
            <p>A few years later, I wanted to “make disability sexier,” in response to usual depictions of disability in
                mass media. I discussed the possibilities for wheelchair-accessible travel videos in Saigon, Vietnam,
                with my project partner Sam. We also wanted to rely on the voices of people who grew up and currently
                lived in the city. It personally meant a lot to me as the entire project was carried out in Saigon,
                Vietnam, where I spent my teenage years. To make a long story short, we took a leap of faith together to
                experiment with several uncommon ways to talk about travel all at once.</p>
            <h2 id="908c">Accessibility Meets YouTube And Travel</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.giantrobot.media/stories/2017/5/30/muui">The Saigon project</a> might have been
                over-ambitious, but it turned out better than we could have imagined. It screened in film festivals
                internationally and garnered positive feedback from wheelchair travelers. I think the primary reason for
                its success was the co-creative way we made it: Sam and I focused on traveling as a personal activity
                that we enjoyed together with my local friends. This approach enabled us to underscore the dire need for
                wheelchair accessibility while avoiding the “otherizing” commonly associated with disabled individuals.
            </p>
            <h3 id="71db">“Trial and Error” Phase</h3>
            <p>Though I personally knew a lot about the city, there was little public information available about
                traveling in a wheelchair in Saigon. Additionally, the wheelchair travel videos we saw for other cities
                were not as fun and exciting as we knew travel actually was. Since our background research showed a lack
                of models to follow, we had to experiment a lot for this project. We did not know whether we could
                actually show the perspective of a wheelchair user in public spaces. We did not know the best way to
                show accessibility information in videos that were meant to be short and entertaining. We had more
                questions than answers, so we decided we just had to explore the possibilities ourselves.</p>

                    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FlsFo7futqok%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlsFo7futqok&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FlsFo7futqok%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"

            <p>After <em>20 States on Wheels</em>, I understood that every disabled person’s needs can be unique. No
                standardized written format can quite exactly provide accurate information. Videos seemed like a
                promising format to experiment with, since a picture is worth a thousand words. What started out with a
                vague idea turned into a brainstorm and on-the-ground experiments. We relied on my past travel guide
                experience and Sam’s background in experimental film. We ended up adding another layer to the mix by
                recording my local friends telling us what they wanted us to know about the places we visited. In the
                end, we combined Sam’s observational footage, my friends’ interviews, my own point-of-view footage, and
                a condensed accessibility summary in the style of <em>20 States</em>. The result was a travel series
                none of us could’ve thought of on our own.</p>

            <h2 id="c2ea"><strong>Moving Forward</strong></h2>
            <p>After the Saigon project, I came back to Seoul, South Korea. As a person with experience with both an
                abled body and a disabled body, there were a lot of areas where I wanted to see a change. One of which
                is subway accessibility. I gathered experts in different fields to build the first accessible subway map
                for Seoul Metro system. We had film makers and journalists who helped us raise awareness about the
                wheelchair accessibility of Seoul metro system: It took 2 or 3 times longer for disabled people to
                travel due to accessibility issues in the Seoul Metro system. We also got helped from designers and
                government officials to start making an interactive wheelchair accessible map.</p>

                    System Map</span></figure>
            <p>Looking back on these projects, I can say that accessibility is an area where a lot of co-creation needs
                to happen in order to raise more awareness.<a
                    href="https://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report.pdf"> Disabled individuals usually
                    do not have equal access to education, employment, and healthcare opportunities.</a> More often than
                not, they do not get the right kind of services in their everyday activities. Accessibility is involved
                in every possible aspect of people’s lives.</p>
            <p>Projects like <em>10 Days in Saigon</em> and <em>20 States on Wheels</em> are just the tip of the
                iceberg. There are many more projects in motion today, thanks to the efforts put forth to co-create a
                more inclusive society. Though it is no secret that the world can be quite challenging when it comes to
                individuals with disabilities, there is still a lot of work to be done to make people around the world
                more conscious of the issue at hand.</p>
