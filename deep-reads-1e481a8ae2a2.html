                <li>While we’re at it, let’s get our terms straight: are we talking<a
                        href="http://uploadvr.com/virtual-reality-vs-360-degree-video-semantic-divide/"> VR or
                        360-degree video</a>? Everyone keep it civil now. After all, “VR is (finally) departing the
                    realm of novelty for the promised land of mainstream adoption. The language we build for it now will
                    have a direct impact on the growth of these two emerging genres, which can determine how they grow
                    and what they become.”</li>
                <li>One problem with calling everything “VR,” <a
                        href="https://medium.com/@blaurel/what-is-virtual-reality-77b876d829ba#.hp7325o9a">writes
                        seasoned independent media scholar Brenda Laurel</a>, is that “When we use the term just because
                    it’s sexy, its meaning spreads like an oil slick over our media and dilutes it such a degree that we
                    no longer know what it means.” She provides a handy checklist of core characteristics for VR,
                    including using “the participant’s sensorium as a camera.”</li>

                <li>OK, so now you know what you’re making, and what to call it. Now who’s going to be experiencing it,
                    and how will they feel? Design thinking to the rescue! See how two VR storytellers <a
                        href="https://medium.com/stanford-d-school/the-storyteller-s-guide-to-the-virtual-reality-audience-19e92da57497#.sixsydgmn">prototyped
                        an audience experience</a>. Takeaways? “There is no such thing as a neutral observer,” “looking
                    is doing,” and the storyteller’s role is that of a matador—you can wave the cape to direct
                    attention, but you can’t control the bull.</li>

                <li>Speaking of feelings, let’s move the VR debate beyond simple claims of “empathy,”<a
                        href="https://medium.com/@HInstitute/vr-going-beyond-the-empathy-machine-d6245146765c#.qzyfz1m3u">
                        argue the impact experts over at the Harmony Institute</a>. “Saying VR is an empathy machine is
                    like saying a paintbrush is an art machine.”</li>
                <li>Ava Kofman also <a
                        href="https://www.guernicamag.com/daily/ava-kofman-will-virtual-reality-make-us-feel-better/">considers
                        this question</a> in <em>Guernica, </em>writing “It would be naïve to assume that a single
                    experience, in virtual reality or outside of it, would necessarily transform a lifetime of stored
                    beliefs into a stroke of insight.”</li>
                <li>Finally, VR might be all the rage right now, but AR is hot on its heels. Read all about it in this
                    <em>Wired </em>piece: “<a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/magic-leap-vr/">The Untold story of
                        Magic Leap, the World’s Most Secretive Startup</a>”. How does it work? “Artificial reality
                    exploits peculiarities in our senses. It effectively hacks the human brain in dozens of ways to
                    create what can be called a chain of persuasion.” Cool, right? But just in time for Halloween, also
                    just a bit scary.
