            <h2 id="1e6d"><strong>New Frontiers for Online Persuasion — and the Role of the Documentary
                    Storyteller</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>By Ben Moskowitz</strong></p>
            <p>In a chapter written in early 2016 for <em><a
                        href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/i-docs/9780231181235">i-Docs: the Evolving Practices of
                        Interactive Documentary</a></em> I argued that the web’s greatest contribution to documentary
                will be the ability to “personalize” stories to individual viewers.</p>
            <p>Events in the past year have demonstrated the power of this kind of data-driven persuasion, suggesting
                that storytellers working in the public interest will have no choice if they want to keep up.</p>
            <p>The day after Donald Trump shocked the world with an unexpected victory in the US presidential campaign,
                a little-known company in London published a <a
                    href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cambridge-analytica-congratulates-president-elect-donald-trump-and-vice-president-elect-mike-pence-300359987.html">press
                    release</a>, proclaiming: “We are thrilled that our revolutionary approach to data-driven
                communication has played such an integral part in President-elect Trump’s extraordinary win.”</p>
            <p>The company was Cambridge Analytica, which had been quietly touting itself as a pioneer of “psychographic
                targeting.”</p>
            <p>It’s an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/cambridge-analytica.html?_r=0">open
                    question</a> as to whether Cambridge Analytica — or the practice of psychographic targeting itself —
                ultimately made the difference in the outcome of the US election. That question is now occupying legions
                of politicos, data scientists and investigators. But the emergence of these practices in the world of
                political campaigns is noteworthy, and a bellwether for online persuasion in general.</p>
            <h3 id="ec83"><strong>So what is psychographic targeting anyway?</strong></h3>
            <p>Political campaigns are increasingly indistinguishable from ad campaigns, and targeted online ad buys
                have been standard practice for many years. But they have historically been based on demographics
                (gender, race, education level, and so on). Platforms such as Facebook and DoubleClick enable ad buyers
                to target viewers based on these demographic characteristics. So, for instance, an 18-year-old woman
                will be served a different political ad than a 54-year-old man.</p>
            <p>Now, companies such as Cambridge Analytica are emerging as middlemen to help clients target and tailor
                appeals to each individual, based on <em>their actual psychological attributes</em>. This is called
                “psychographic targeting.”</p>
            <p>Cambridge Analytica uses a 30-year-old personality model called <a
                    href="https://ocean.cambridgeanalytica.org/">OCEAN</a> (scoring across indicators of “openness,
                conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, neuroticism”). It provides a fairly reliable predictor
                of a person’s motivations, needs, and fears — and, by extension, the kinds of advertisements and appeals
                that are most likely to be effective.</p>
            <p>Psychographic targeting is more viable than ever, because OCEAN profiles can be statistically inferred
                from the publicly available data that people willingly give away on social networks — including posts
                and likes. For a political campaign, this creates interesting possibilities for persuading specific
                pockets of voters based on their specific personality traits.</p>
            <p>In a story describing the Trump campaign’s online data operation, <em>Forbes </em>revealed that “on the
                day of the third presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, <a
                    href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2016/11/22/exclusive-interview-how-jared-kushner-won-trump-the-white-house/">Trump’s
                    team tested 175,000 different ad variations for his arguments</a>. The messages differed for the
                most part only in microscopic details, in order to target the recipients in the optimal psychological
                way: different headings, colors, captions, with a photo or video.”</p>
            <p>Vice’s<em> Motherboard</em> describes how Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix <a
                    href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mg9vvn/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win">demonstrated
                    the power of psychographic targeting to an audience in New York</a> based on an example related to
                gun rights: “For a highly neurotic and conscientious audience the threat of a burglary — and the
                insurance policy of a gun” a person would be served an ad with “the hand of an intruder smashing a
                window.” Conversely: “people who care about tradition, and habits, and family” would be served an ad
                that “shows a man and a child standing in a field at sunset, both holding guns… shooting ducks.”</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>We are entering a strange new era of politics and algorithmic persuasion, made possible by
                        the native business model of the internet.</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3 id="981e"><strong>From mass media to me media</strong></h3>
            <p>More and more, the Cambridge Analyticas of the world are using commercial internet data to personalize
                appeals, shift opinions, and ultimately shape politics itself. The comparatively simple personalization
                of today — that is, the fact that you passively receive advertisements intended just for you — is
                becoming the foundation of a new approach to online communication. From the relatively innocuous
                targeted banner or pre-roll ad, we are moving into a world in which personalization is more magic and
                less detectable, thanks to developments in AI and computer graphics and advertisers’ ability to pay for
                eyeballs on demand.</p>
            <p>Imagine a future, enabled by psychometrics and real-time compositing, where all media adapts itself to
                the specific viewer. If a BBC documentary on endangered species leaves a viewer insufficiently moved,
                perhaps the documentary should adapt its color grading and music until it finds the right emotional
                knob? If a war documentary is too brutalizing for a particular viewer, perhaps the documentary should
                read the viewer’s expression and skip the footage where the bomb goes off in the marketplace? (The BBC
                is in fact one among many organizations exploring how to enable this kind of personalization — its
                R&amp;D unit is working on an initiative called <a
                    href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/visual-perceptive-media">Visual Perceptive Media</a>, which
                aspires to “personalised video which responds to your personality and preferences.”)</p>
            <p>Now think about this kind of technique applied in the realm of politics. The consequences of
                personalization could be quite dark if such techniques were to be applied ubiquitously or unethically.
            </p>
            <p>An experimental study in 2004 delivered tailored political ads to test subjects. In the ads served to the
                test group, presidential candidates’ faces were subtly blended with facial characteristics of the
                viewer. It turns out that if you show someone a political ad for George W. Bush, with their own facial
                characteristics blended in, they are more likely to want to vote for him (or any candidate, for that
                matter). Advertising that uses personalization for this kind of subliminal effect could be quietly
                deployed across social media in a not-too-distant future — and would not be too far removed from the
                data-driven persuasion and targeting techniques that prop up the web economy today. <a
                    href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/07/what-do-you-do-when-you-cannot-believe-your-own-eyes/533154/">Just
                    wait until these technologies collide with the fake news economy</a>, where there is even less
                accountability.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>These are important developments with important social ramifications. They must be communicated to the
                public and opened to public debate. But given the abstract nature of these problems, what are social
                storytellers to do? The only choice, arguably, is to adopt these same techniques as the persuaders: To
                use personalization as an explanatory device, and to use personalization to become more persuasive.</p>
            <h3 id="f97a"><strong>Baby steps</strong></h3>
            <p>Why shouldn’t storytellers be using all the techniques that have made the rest of the web economy work,
                and applying them to documentary film online?</p>
            <p>What would it mean to apply these personalization techniques to documentary? Might they allow interactive
                producers to make social issue storytelling more persuasive? We can consider a few common tropes that
                might emerge:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motion graphics</strong> — Producers might show viewers personalized statistics to put their
                    own experience in broader context. A simple widget that reports on the minimum wage in the viewer’s
                    state could be animated into a more filmic narrative about income inequality, which would presumably
                    make for more relatable and engaging viewing.</li>
                <li><strong>Scene selection</strong> — Producers might play with narrative structure by affecting scene
                    order depending on who’s watching. In a documentary about steelworkers, imagine there’s a specific
                    subject who deeply clicks with 15 percent of viewers and strikes as a very sympathetic figure. But
                    85 percent of viewers can’t stand him, get distracted and tune out. In a conventional documentary,
                    there’s a hard creative choice to be made. Perhaps it’s possible to have it both ways?</li>
                <li><strong>Voice-overs</strong> — Producers might lean on computers for help with narrative voiceovers.
                    Dynamically generative scripts may be read by modern synthetic voice synthesis in lieu of people in
                    a recording booth. Could computerized narrators customize the script and address viewers directly,
                    increasing the emotional and persuasive power for that demographic? Alternately, might producers
                    automatically select from a number of pre-recorded voiceovers? What if the relevance of an online
                    story could be broadened by recording multiple master narratives with diverse narrators, and
                    selecting the narrator most appropriate for each viewing? Perhaps some viewers will respond better
                    to an elderly Asian woman narrator, whereas others will stay spellbound by a 15-year-old narrator?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                <p>There are immense creative possibilities to be explored.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Some say that this production style is technically unfeasible and won’t work. If that’s you then I’d
                suggest that you take a look at Blast Theory’s <a
                    href="http://www.blasttheory.co.uk/projects/karen/">Karen</a> app (2015), Sandra Gaudenzi’s <em><a
                        href="http://i-docs.org/2015/10/04/digital-me-is-more-than-your-digital-you/">Digital
                        Me</a></em> (2014), or Brett Gaylor’s <em><a href="https://donottrack-doc.com">Do Not
                        Track</a></em><em> </em>series (2015). All of these lean on personalization to tell a more
                persuasive story.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/486/1*TbDhm5Q0xWoCnw4SfflfrA.png"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <h3 id="0880">Whither the author?</h3>
            <p>Others worry that personalized media requires the auteur to cede authorial control. These ideas are
                especially offensive to the conservative, old guard of documentary filmmakers who already regard the web
                suspiciously because it has thoroughly disrupted film finance and distribution. To these
                traditionalists, targeted and procedural media defeat the whole purpose of quality storytelling.</p>
            <p>But it can be argued that procedural storytelling offers even greater authorial control, because it
                enables an evolution from “one-to-many storytelling” to “one-to-one storytelling with many people.”
                Personalization, in theory, offers even finer-grained control of the message and experience for an
                individual viewer.</p>
            <p>Could computer-enhanced narratives ever truly feel as intimate as finely tuned works? Won’t these stories
                feel somehow disingenuous and hollow? This is a question that can only be answered through years of
                experimentation.</p>
            <p>As the sophistication and seamlessness of personalized storytelling significantly improve in coming
                years, the ethics of personalization is something the field will need to seriously grapple with.
                Ubiquitous personalization represents a new frontier of propaganda and could be a threat to people’s
                cognitive security.</p>
            <p>This is an issue that transcends consumer protection on the internet, and it is bigger than the present
                discourse around privacy and surveillance. What can be known about internet users is one thing; what can
                be done with this information to manipulate them is entirely another. Many interests, not just
                advertisers, will be using targeting and personalization to exploit people’s individual cognitive biases
                and weaknesses. This has significance for public opinion across nearly every social issue imaginable.
                This is the brave new data-driven world into which we are headed.</p>
            <p>A large part of the responsibility to explore the social consequences of these changes will fall to
                journalists and documentary storytellers — and their stories will need to capture the attention and the
                imagination of the public at least as effectively as well-resourced commercial and government interests.
                It won’t be enough for documentary storytellers to keep an eye on the watchers. In a sense, they’ll need
                to create documentaries that watch their viewers.</p>
