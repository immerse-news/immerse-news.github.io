            <blockquote>
                <p>“Where do you begin telling someone that their world is not the only one?”- voices Lee Maracle</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Grand narratives of Western modernity and the Anthropocene have contributed to a universalist view of the
                world and binary distinctions between man and nature. This trend of unsustainable development has
                exploited and erased life systems, as well as fueled climate change. Across the world, pluralistic
                cosmologies have been rendered destitute by this universalist model. This echoes in how we engage with
                the world, the structures of knowledge, ways of knowing and being. Real Time 3D Technology like video
                games and immersive experiences often consciously and subconsciously reinforce a worldview of
                colonization and conquest. Even in open world games where we are tricked by our freedom to wander, the
                underlying game mechanics, constraints and reward systems are subliminally shaping our decision making.
                These simulated worlds, according to William Uricchio, MIT Professor of Comparative Media Studies and
                Founder of the Open Documentary Lab, can be more powerful than representations. Uricchio says:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“This is not about the (story)teller that happens around a fire, this is about the discoverer, the
                    process.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>With growing discourse around decolonization, climate change and alternative forms of development, in the
                words of Katrina Cizek, lead designer of the workshop at Co-Creation Studio, MIT Open Documentary Lab:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“We’re figuring out how to flip the narrative. And now we need to flip the simulation.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>For the organizing team,</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“Worlding, in the context of real time digital technology, is a verb that unravels these layers of
                    inscriptions, the assumptions of the way “things are’’ to show they haven’t always been that way,
                    that there are many worlds, and to imagine possible worlds through collective, democratic and
                    artistic processes.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In its debut edition, the<a href="https://cocreationstudio.mit.edu/worlding/"> Worlding Workshop 2022</a>
                was a week-long intensive knowledge-sharing program from September 27 — October 4, 2022 that incubated
                five storyworld projects at the intersection of five distinct disciplines: Climate Futures, Land Use
                Planning, Co-creation, Real Time 3D Game Engines (RT3D) and Documentary Storytelling. It explored how we
                might use game-engines to imagine and build community-based sustainable worlds and perhaps render them
                possible in real life through policy change. The stage was set with a<a

            <p>The teams consisted of land-use planners, placemakers, climate scientists, documentarians, technologists,
                worldbuilders, decision-makers, scholars and media-makers. Featured in this article are the five
                projects, each with distinct storytelling approaches and methodologies yet unified by shared value
                systems and visions.</p>
            <h2 id="591f">The Future Current: Year 2180</h2>
            <p><em><a href="https://youtu.be/YmGZUAJFmWw">The Future Current: Year 2180</a></em><em> (2022)</em> is a
                RT3D first-person open world game set in a data-driven dystopian future. Interestingly, it was created
                by a process that consists of forecasting climate crisis trends based on actual data, for example Sao
                Paulo tribal communities being affected by forest fires and New York preparing for storms, and using
                them as a foundation to build a speculative world. Speculative worlds need speculative technologies, and
                in this speculative New York, for example, it is the ability to recapture energy from the storm to
                repower the city.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/450/1*FuTN7IYNIkbFRWVbn7Bsdg.png"

            </figure>
            <p>Deploying time tested game mechanics in a refreshing context, the game’s objective is to complete
                “climate quests’’ via persona pathways that include Explorers (that chase storms and prepare cities for
                them), Creators (that design solutions to ensure survival) and — my personal favorite — Destroyers (that
                help recycle the old city). Compared to your average MMORPG in which you hunt animals for resources and
                points, in this world you gain points by catching poachers in the act.</p>

            <p>Their work also included imagining the Yawanawa tribal community expanding in Sao Paulo by the year 2180
                in a context where forest fires are desertifying the rainforests. Through this methodological process,
                <em>The Future Current: Year 2180 </em>builds a realistic, fact-driven speculative fictional ground
                powered by insight.

            <p>Following a different trajectory, <em><a

                    (2022)</a> explores the intersections of criminal and environmental justice with young adults on
                probation in Liverpool, in the UK — a country built off long-standing relationships to colonialism and
                racial and ethnic “other”-ing. Bringing together a cross-disciplinary team from criminologists to
                digital media artists, <em>Wild Natures </em>creates an interactive and imaginative space for
                contemplation, education and political engagement.</p>

            <p>For <em>Wild Natures</em>, the expansion to RT3D is more about using this technology as a tool for
                workshopping and futurescoping rather than as an outcome itself. Their process questions how RT3D can be
                used to envision pasts, presents and futures with young people who face multiple disadvantages at the
                cross section of social and climate justice.</p>

            <p>An episodic immersive combining verite footage, scientific data powered simulations and environmental
                photogrammetry, it shows the plight and courage of these farmers in facing these dwindling sources of
                water and historical inequities, addressing themes spanning Family Heritage and Loss, to the Collapse of
                the American Dream, from Unsustainable Agriculture to The Aridification of the West and Inequitable
                Water Rights.</p>

            <p>One farmer in particular mentions the Indigenous people, the Anasazis, Hopis and Pueblo who never
                imagined that the water body could dry out. This struck me as an echo of imagined futures of earlier
                times.</p>
            <h2 id="eaaf"><em><strong>Seabreeze Bop City</strong></em></h2>
            <p><em>Seabreeze Bop City (2022)</em> is a RT3D storytelling project based in North Carolina that celebrates
                the rich Black cultural history of SeaBreeze, one of the only resort towns available to the Black
                community in the 1920–60’s and a region that suffered major destruction from Hurricane Hazel in 1954.
                Using lidar scans, 360 videos, oral history and an archive of storytelling assets, the project tells a
                story about land loss and the power of rising waters made frequent by climate change and infrastructural
                failures.</p>

            <p>The immersive experience celebrates the vibrant culture of music, dance and intergenerational memory
                present, working nonlinearly to collapse pasts, presents and futures into a co-created space bursting at
                the seams with heritage and vision.</p>

            <p><em>Seabreeze Bop City</em> is an example of using RT3D to call up the past while imagining preferable
                environmental, water and economic futures. In an area increasingly vulnerable to the relentless rise of
                the Atlantic Ocean, the project’s creators’ hope is to create a piece of media with the potential to
                shape policy.</p>
            <h2 id="a053"><em><strong>Waves of Buffalo</strong></em></h2>
            <p>Last but not the least, <em>Waves of Buffalo (2022)</em> is an extension of a documentary film called
                <em>Singing Back the Buffalo (2024)</em> that is currently in production.
            </p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/450/1*AE9CLd6k5WNfrM5pbl6mPw.png"

                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>Both attempt to raise awareness around Indigenous efforts to revitalize the populations of North American
                buffalo, eradicated at the end of the 19th century. Many Indigenous people in North America embrace an
                ancestral kinship with buffaloes. However more and more people are growing disconnected with this
                connection with the buffalo, the land and everything they embody. By attempting to recreate the
                experience of witnessing a herd of buffaloes passing by, <em>Waves of Buffalo </em>stirs what its
                creators call “buffalo consciousness.” Their core concept is to create a land based, multi-sensory and
                durational installation that manifests the experience of a buffalo herd passing by.</p>
            <p>This quintet of RT3D experiences from North America was also complemented by a spread of projects from
                around the world. Overall, Worlding 2022 presented new constellations amidst seemingly siloed themes and
                disciplines. In storytelling, speculative narratives and documentaries seem like different camps. In the
                face of today’s realities, it is pertinent for the two to come together at a middle ground, reconnect
                and converse with fields like policy and planning.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“Planners are often the narrators of the climate change story for broad segments of the population.
                    How they define the problem can determine a community’s resilience and adaptive capacity.” says
                    Marina Psaros, head of sustainability at Unity and lead on Worlding at Unity. “Technology can help
                    us visualize and communicate those worlds.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Worlding is, thus, a love child of this potential — of speculative design, land-use planning, documentary
                storytelling, RT3Ds and of co-creation. By embracing co-creative, non-linear, participatory and
                interdisciplinary mindsets, we experience and envision alternative pluriversal worlds that are
                constantly in coexistence, for as put by Donna Harraway,</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“It matters what worlds world worlds.”</p>
