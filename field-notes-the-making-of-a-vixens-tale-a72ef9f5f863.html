            <h2 id="4fad">The Making of <em>A Vixen’s Tale</em></h2>
            <p><em>“A Vixen’s Tale” is a combined physical and augmented reality experience inspired by Leoš Janáček’s
                    opera, </em>The Cunning Little Vixen<em>, created by Arcade for Welsh National Opera (WNO). The free
                    experience runs from Saturday 5th October to Sunday 3rd November at Wales Millennium Centre in
                    Cardiff, with plans for national and international tours to follow. Tickets to the opera are
                    available </em><a

            <p>We started <a href="https://arcade.ltd/">Arcade</a> in London in 2017, and, after some early high-profile
                work with the likes of Merlin (<a href="https://arcade.ltd/sea-life-ar-chatbot/">SEA LIFE</a>, <a
                    href="https://arcade.ltd/arcade-launches-the-new-madame-tussauds-ar-app-fame-cam/">Madame
                    Tussauds</a>) and the <a href="https://arcade.ltd/roald-dahl-marvellous-missenden-ar-trials/">Roald
                    Dahl Museum</a>, we were accepted onto Digital Catapult’s <a
                    href="https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/projects/augmentor/">Augmentor</a> programme, which brought us
                to the attention of <a href="https://wno.org.uk/">WNO</a>. When we got WNO’s call inviting us to pitch
                for their latest immersive installation, we were thrilled.</p>
            <h3 id="edd6">An AR Tunnel Book</h3>
            <p>We had a lot of fun coming up with concepts for the pitch (some of the weirder and wackier ones were
                quickly locked away!) but settled on an idea that borrows from the world of set design: the ‘tunnel
                book’.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/499/385/1*EAH1iHuNxJlfPMoofXqFlg.jpeg"
                    width="499"><label class="margin-toggle" for="15698471914229736480">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="15698471914229736480"><span class="marginnote">An 18th
                    century tunnel book</span></figure>
            <p>Tunnel books were used extensively in the 18th and 19th centuries as a set design tool —
                three-dimensional mock-ups that show how a set would work. They can typically be folded flat but when
                extended offer an illusion of perspective and depth. Traditional tunnel books are constructed in
                miniature, but what would something like this be like at human scale? We were excited by the idea of
                “stepping in” to a tunnel book and augmenting the journey through the arches with all kinds of playful
                interactions in AR. Fortunately for us, the WNO team were equally intrigued.</p>
            <p>The centrepiece(s) of the experience would, therefore, be a series of five beautiful wooden arches, each
                one 8ft high and 16ft wide. This approach of merging a physical installation with an immersive digital
                experience gave us the chance to flex both our architecture and digital muscles.</p>

                    scale tunnel book” concept</span></figure>
            <h2 id="761b">A walk in the woods</h2>
            <p><em>The Cunning Little Vixen</em> follows the titular character through her life and the experiences that
                define her, largely set in and around a forest. We took the themes from these experiences — from the
                playfulness of youth through to rebellion, love, joy and, ultimately, grief — and mapped them across the
                arches, which also came to represent the seasons from spring through to winter. This concept gave us a
                rich canvas on which to build the physical and digital experiences, walking alongside the Vixen as she
                journeys through her tale.</p>
            <p>To make the experience as visually impactful as possible we commissioned the illustrator <a
                    href="https://www.thelastdodo.be/">Xavier Segers</a>, whose work brought the narrative and emotion
                of each arch stunningly to life. Suddenly these five arches and their associated season and phase in the
                Vixen’s story, became incredible works in their own right.</p>

            <p>Cardiff Theatrical Services (CTS), WNO’s wholly-owned set design &amp; construction team, were tasked
                with the challenge of turning our designs into full-scale reality.</p>

            <h3 id="4c51">An augmented experience</h3>
            <p>To augment the physical experience and respond to the objective of engaging new opera audiences of all
                ages, we introduced an extensive range of playful interactions, immersive illustrations, animations, and
                soundscapes using location-specific AR, set across the five arches. Accessed via mobile devices and
                headphones, visitors can walk with the opera’s titular Vixen, seeing, hearing and participating in her
                narrative for themselves.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/480/270/1*1TCrnzkBg38E_Qr26TWtYA.gif"

            </figure>
            <p>We built the Vixen and all other dynamic elements from scratch, rigging, animating and texturing the
                models to align with Xavier’s designs. To make the experience as intuitive and accessible as possible,
                we also cast the Vixen herself as your guide, indicating what she wants you to do as you progress
                through the arches.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The delight on people’s faces (of all ages) as they discovered the Vixen and cracked the various
                challenges was incredibly rewarding.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/449/1*_AhrnSr_87b3J0DSI8o8fw.png"

            </figure>
            <h3 id="667d">Emotional impact</h3>
            <p>Throughout <em>A Vixen’s Tale</em>, the audience is immersed into the emotions the Vixen herself
                experiences through the course of her journey.</p>
            <p>Sound, therefore, has a huge role. As with the visual assets, the audio is also augmented. Working with
                sound designer <a href="http://www.owenpeters.co.uk/Sound/Home.html">Owen Peters</a>, we developed a
                series of ambient soundscapes, each reflecting the themes and emotions of each arch and responding to
                visitors’ movement through the installation.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/714/1*I2IIhCTRyeWxwqrQg1l4jQ.png"
                    width="800"><label class="margin-toggle" for="10862164220640835750">&#9997;&#xFE0E;</label><input
                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>The final, critical piece of the emotional experience is the way <em>A Vixen’s Tale</em> echoes the
                overarching theme of <em>The Cunning Little Vixen </em>itself: the natural circle of life. We’ve hidden
                a few extra surprises to reward those who complete the journey through the arches. As in the opera, the
                end of <em>A Vixen’s Tale</em> has its own tragedy, but it also becomes a whole new beginning. (Hint:
                when you get to the end, turn around.)</p>

            </figure>
            <h3 id="1a7f">A multi-layered experience</h3>
            <p>The experience is inherently multi-layered, with both physical and immersive components. We loved the way
                this caters for different types of audience and levels of engagement, and wanted to push it even
                further.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/800/449/1*y1LQVT6fk1swNHyINsxq0Q.png"

                    class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox" id="10862164220640835750"><span class="marginnote"></span>
            </figure>
            <p>To this end we introduced two complementary experiences, accessed via Snapchat. These Snap lenses could
                give casual or remote audiences their own immersive Vixen experiences and open <em>A Vixen’s Tale</em>
                up even more.</p>
            <p>We embedded the first in a poster campaign that invited people in and around the Cardiff area to meet the
                Vixen and get a sneak peek of the arches.</p>
            <figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/270/480/1*UFyidMTuxhSw-PlReB3b2w.gif"

            </figure>
            <p>We also added a second fun lens that could be experienced anywhere in the world, turning people into the
                Vixen (and her foxy friend, if there is more than one person in view). By accessing the rear camera,
                users could also place the Vixen wherever they happened to be, and let her run around.</p>
