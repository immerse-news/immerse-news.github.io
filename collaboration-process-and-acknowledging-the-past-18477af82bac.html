            <h3 id="8775"><em>Insights from six Sundance New Frontier artists featured on the “Brown Girls and the New
                    Frontier” panel</em></h3>
            <p>As part of the 2021 Sundance Film Festival, <a href="https://browngirlsdocmafia.com/">Brown Girls Doc
                    Mafia</a> (BGDM) joined six creators with projects in the New Frontier program to discuss process
                and practice in the realm of emerging media and immersive technologies. BGDM is a community of women and
                non-binary people of color working in the documentary film industry who are committed to sharing
                resources and cutting through oppressive industry structures. Their “<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI_hsBOEbto&amp;feature=emb_logo">Brown Girls and the New
                    Frontier</a>” panel highlighted each project’s lead artist (all members of BGDM), accompanied by
                another member of their team and moderated by VR filmmaker and worldbuilder <a
                    href="https://medium.com/@PaisleyYasmine">Paisley Smith</a>. Collaboration and related questions of
                accessibility and the tools we use to create and tell stories were the central focus of the talk. How
                can we develop deep, worthwhile connections with creative team members, especially during a pandemic
                that feels so isolating? Identity inevitably informs the work we create, but what of the tools that have
                been created for us? How should we think about democratization when designing experiences in new media?

            <p>Of the three projects featured on the panel, all of them construct expansive worlds that challenge
                conventional histories and hegemonic perspectives. <em><strong>The Changing Same: Episode One
                    </strong></em>(Michèle Stephenson and Yasmin Elayat) is an immersive, magical realist pilgrimage
                through the evolution of racial violence in the U.S. via a tethered VR headset. <em><strong>Prison
                        X</strong></em> (Violeta Ayala and Maria Corvera Vargas) is an immersive, interactive VR Andean
                mythological play that weaves magical realism into the rarely depicted reality of Bolivia’s San
                Sebastian prison. <em><strong>Beyond the Breakdown </strong></em>(Grace Lee and Lauren Lee McCarthy), on
                the other hand, is a world-building browser performance wherein Sundance festivalgoers engage with an AI
                and human collaborative team to imagine alternative narratives for our near-future reality. The hope is
                that by articulating these dreams, shaping them with and for community, that idealized world can be
                reverse engineered. On this hope, all six panelists agreed.</p>

                    look like in 2050; <strong>Prison X, </strong>through which viewers encounter devils, saints, old
                    ladies, corrupt prison guards, and even a Western filmmaker, all with different, nuanced
                    relationships to the San Sebastian prison and its history; <strong>The Changing Same: Episode
                        One</strong>, which inverts time and space through history alongside people who have suffered
                    slavery, lynching, and mass incarceration, ultimately landing participants in an Afro-futurist
                    tomorrow that is “attentive and accountable to the violences of the past.”</span></figure>
            <p>Below are four key takeaways, edited for length and clarity, that illuminate guiding principles for
                collaboration and the creation of meaningful new media work in today’s volatile and uncertain world.</p>
            <h3 id="018e"><strong>Invest in the practice, understand your team:</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Yasmin: </strong>The collaboration was the innovation. This project is very groundbreaking in
                many ways, but I would say the process was the real innovation.</p>
            <p><strong>Michèle:</strong> Yasmin implemented a process of artist talks, where each collaborator took time
                to talk about why they were involved in [<em>The Changing Same</em>] and speak to where they’re coming
                from, the work that they do, and what they bring to the process. Innovating in the process is part of
                investing in the practice. If we are open to it and trusting, and we have an ear to it, we create
                something much greater than the sum of our parts. With the energy that comes together, it’s not 2+2=4,
                it’s 2+2=5 and beyond. The more self aware we are of what baggage we bring, and understand what those
                dynamics mean, we can channel it in a way where we create something that’s very beautiful, lasting.
                Others will see themselves too because it’s the human condition.</p>
            <p><strong>Violeta:</strong> As a director, I had to find the strengths of every person. Our key team is 8,
                but our bigger team is more than 20 people all over the world. It was difficult, but then I realized I
                was asking for oranges from an apple tree. I realized I needed to be clear about what I want and clear
                about what my team is capable of giving me. It is very important to understand that nobody is an expert
                in virtual reality, that we are discovering this language and making history. Do a lot of research, read
                a lot. Be open about being held responsible and saying, “well, this won’t work, but maybe this will work
                better, why don’t we try this together.” It then really becomes a co-creative process. You can’t do this
                by yourself.</p>
            <h3 id="99a5"><strong>The tools we use are not neutral:</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Yasmin:</strong> I identify myself as an immersive media artist, a hybrid. I studied computer
                science and went to art school. My career has been at the intersection of technology and storytelling
                ever since. I grew up in Silicon Valley, left it once I was an adult, and have never been back because I
                was not recognizing a space for myself as a higher technologist artist in that kind of culture. I came
                to New York and worked in Egypt. Scatter is a company built by artists; my two co-founders, James George
                and Alexander Porter, are also artists. We make productions not just because we are creators, but so we
                can learn what tools people may need, how to make it more accessible. I see myself as having a
                responsibility as a woman of color and as a founder of a tech company. It’s our responsibility to make
                sure that our tool is available across the world. That’s the only way to build a company that is really
                thinking about the design and who it’s for. It very much has to do with where you come from.</p>
            <p><strong>Lauren:</strong> I got into toolmaking being an artist using open source tools and wanting to
                give back. It was difficult to get involved. These spaces are primarily white and male, with a very
                specific subset working on the tools. I thought, why? A tool is not neutral. It’s embedded with all the
                beliefs and biases of the people that made it. As I was building <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5</a>, I
                thought about who was involved. What is the experience like if you not only want to be a user of the
                tool but maybe be a contributor to it? How do we take down those barriers to access on both sides, and
                what are those barriers? There are just so many when it comes to media art or new media because access
                to the internet is immediately a barrier. Whether it’s an art project or toolmaking, there are these
                related themes that I think about: how we connect with people online, how that experience is different
                for everyone, and what tools we can build that can start to destabilize some of those problematic
                relationships.</p>
            <p><strong>Violeta:</strong> We have to understand that we are fighting against the standardization of
                story, the standardization of technology. We are facing a techno-authoritarian future, as my friend [and
                Immerse editor] Abby Sun says, so we have to bond together to fight this. For instance, you can rig in
                <a href="https://www.mixamo.com/#/">Mixamo</a>. Mixamo is like the Google translator for rigging and
                animation, but all of the bodies are male bodies, white male bodies. Rilda [one of <em>Prison X’</em>s
                3D illustrators] said, our bodies are only 6 heads, but white people’s bodies are 7 heads. We have to
                fight even harder to create our own characters because we can not even build in what was created before.
                Invention is a necessity. If we didn’t, we were going to have to put an Indigenous woman in the body of
                a white man. Don’t expect the technology to know everything. The only thing I know is that I am
                discovering everything as I go.
            </p>
            <h3 id="1d25"><strong>The real world should inform the work:</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Grace:</strong> We were bonded in the process of making <em>Beyond the Breakdown</em>. We’re in
                the middle of the pandemic, stuck, noticing what’s happening to the world around us. Many people have
                experienced this during COVID, asking “what is really important to me?” It’s these human connections. I
                always come back to that when thinking about this project, how we built it and how we wanted people to
                connect even when separated by these Zoom boxes. It was great timing with Sundance, but it was all
                coursing within us, this desire to make these connections with the stuff that really matters to us.</p>
            <p><strong>Violeta:</strong> I met Maria in Berlin, then we caught up again in Bolivia, when we were in the
                middle of a revolution. We were outside my house, trying to work with the protesting. It seemed like the
                world would end at the time. It was the end of 2019 with the election in Bolivia. We had a very intense
                period where we were pretty much locked up in our house. We didn’t know who was fighting who, what was
                happening, and we didn’t know what to do. What was more important, to make this project or to really
                join what was happening in the street? That was me, Maria, and Rilda, and Dan. That created a very
                strong bond.</p>
            <p><strong>Michèle:</strong> For us, there were a couple of things that were specifically important to
                acknowledge, as those who have suffered from the racial caste system. One is not just the violence that
                occurs or has occurred over the last 400 years across the Americas around white supremacy but also Black
                joy and resilience. We acknowledge our ancestors and we acknowledge the past, not just to accept the
                future but to reimagine our present. All of that is in this experience. And so the timing, when you
                think about it, ironically, couldn’t be better. The pandemic, if anything, made us more creative.</p>
            <p>The uprisings, the spectacle lynching of George Floyd, which is at the crux of the story that we tell but
                in a way that centers the Black experience, also fueled this storytelling for all of us: Yasmin, Joe
                [Brewster], and our creative designer Rad Mora. When this happened, this became our healing and we
                became even more entrenched. We would meet minimally once a month before, physically, and then
                virtuality forced us to meet even more often. We also met to process the uprisings in what we were
                doing. There was a lot of communication in Google chats about our own healing, understanding, and
                handling our fear. As 2020 shows, uprising gets into fashion. How do we take advantage of that and make
                sure that the unapologetic position that we have held for the last four years has an opportunity to be
                birthed? Less compromise is needed until the doors close again, as history has shown us in cyclical ways
                over hundreds of years.</p>
            <h3 id="d08e"><strong>Don’t neglect legacy:</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Violeta:</strong> It’s all about educating ourselves, understanding, reading, learning, trying,
                figuring this pipeline, and also being generous enough to share this pipeline with everyone else.
                Indigenous people in Bolivia, Quechua, Aymara, Guaraní, and in all the Americas will be able to create
                our own stories with our own characters, with budgets that we’d never even dreamed of. This is a time
                when we have to get inside, share our process, and bond with each other. We are still going up the
                mountain for our brothers and sisters who will come after us. In Quechua, we don’t believe we go to
                Heaven. We go back to the Earth and we become a seed and from that seed, a new tree will come. I’m a
                fool, and as a fool I want to say that we all can do this, for the next generation to come.</p>
            <p><strong>Michèle:</strong> In the same way that we’re creating seeds for others, BIPOC women before us
                have been here at the forefront of this technology. This is not new. It’s not just in virtual reality,
                it’s in other immersive spaces. From Jackie Jones’ very first summit in Jackson, Mississippi, back in
                the 2000s, thinking about ways for the Black community to maximize access but also reimagine and create,
                to Kamal Sinclair, to Shari Frilot, to Nonny de la Peña. We stand on that road. There is a legacy in the
                creative process thinking about democratization, but we as creators can’t do it all either. Audience
                development and access to the technology has to happen. As technology becomes cheaper down the road, we
                have to think about how we keep the legacy going.</p>
            <p><strong>Maria:</strong> When you see <em>Prison X</em> and every artist that took part of it, you can see
                so much love and passion that went into the project. I’m happy my nieces can see Quilla [one of the
                characters], can somehow recognize themselves in it, instead of having this blond figure from
                <em>Frozen</em> that doesn’t have anything to do with us and doesn’t speak to us. It’s just an
                imposition of this person “every girl” is supposed to want to be. I see the need for creating our own
                characters, our own costumes. The work needs a part of us in it, and this is what I see in all of the
                characters, in the music, and in this whole world that we have created.
