            <h3 id="0276">This walkthrough self-referentially explicates creator Bryan LeBeuf’s integration of physical
                and video game-based recordings of childhood memories</h3>
            <p><em>Home Movie</em> is an interactive new media documentary that allows players to explore disappearing
                neighborhoods from Detroit’s West Side. The game animates the childhood memories of its creator, Bryan
                LeBeuf, by melding archival media, including contemporaneous cable television and LeBeuf family photos,
                with classic game aesthetics. For users familiar with historic console games, navigating through the
                sparsely populated environment of <em>Home Movie</em> evokes memories untethered from the geographic
                specificity of LeBeuf’s Detroit. In this context, hardware memory functions as an extension of personal
                and collective memory. By reducing archival footage into 16-bit resolution, cutscenes in Home Movie —
                “memories” — visually depict the degradation of human memory, while the fragmentary volumetric
                cityscapes rendered by sophisticated game engines and LiDAR technology suggest the destruction of memory
                spaces.</p>
            <p>This guide draws on a rich history of video game walkthroughs and strategy guides. Perhaps the most
                visible of these publications is the Nintendo Player’s Guide series, which released more than one
                hundred titles between 1987 and 2007. Although commercial publishing of video game strategy guides has
                declined since the proliferation of player-generated guides freely available online, major releases are
                still accompanied by lavishly illustrated tomes celebrating the art and narrative of a given title. For
                Game Studies scholar Mia Consalvo, walkthroughs complement the spatial narrative progression of video
                games with a more traditional mode of story-telling which is read intertextually by game fans.
                Referencing the intertextual format and shifting narrative voice of the genre, this guide invites
                readers to navigate the remembered neighborhoods of <em>Home Movie</em> alongside the game or as a
                standalone text.</p>
