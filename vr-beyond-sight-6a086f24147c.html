            <h3 id="301f">How the Blind Burners collective opened pathways for non-visual access to virtual reality —
                from Burning Man to beyond</h3>
            <p>By Harsha Balasubramanian and Chris Hainsworth</p>
            <h2 id="1f2e"><strong>Building Non-Visual Access to Virtual Reality</strong></h2>
            <p>“VR does not stand for visual reality.” This is a mantra for<a href="https://blindburners.com/"> Blind
                    Burners</a>: an international collective of artists formed around a shared desire for
                self-expression in virtual reality and an ethos of inclusive production processes.</p>
            <p>VR continues to make progress with innovations in visual fidelity, hand controllers and wireless
                headsets, while simultaneously excluding blind and low vision creators and audiences. In Summer 2021, as
                part of virtual Burning Man, Blind Burners’ collective of blind, low vision and sighted artists gathered
                to create their own <a
                    href="https://account.altvr.com/worlds/1663423622229787252/spaces/2009872066664202375">virtual
                    worlds</a> in which to explore non-visual access, producing an art gallery and a <em>Temple of
                    Accessibility</em>.</p>

            <p>Whilst Burning Man’s temples for many are a powerful contemplative experience focused on <a
                    href="https://templeguardians.burningman.org/about-the-temples/">spiritual cleansing or
                    psychological release</a>, our Temple of Accessibility was an attempt to playfully call “bullshit”
                on Burning Man’s claim to “radical inclusion” in its <a
                    href="https://burningman.org/about/10-principles/">ten principles</a>. Given the wealth,
                connections, and day-jobs of so many in the Burning Man-Silicon Valley Tech Nexus, it is extraordinary
                that digital accessibility was so absent from planning for 2020’s digital burns.</p>

                    Burners’ <em>Temple of Accessibility</em></span></figure>
            <p>Inspired by the art piece <em><a
                        href="http://www.kateraudenbush.com/futures-past#:~:text=machinations%20of%20man.-,Future&#39;s%20Past%20is%20a%20symbol%20of%20the%20human%20evolution%20of,by%20both%20integrity%20and%20ignorance.">Futures
                        Past</a></em> (2012) by Kate Raudenbush and its juxtaposition of ancient wisdom with modern
                technologies, we decided to build our own humble stone temple Burning Man offering. We offered our
                experiences trying to access food delivery apps, dating apps and creator tools, sharing how our attempts
                to find food, love and opportunities for self-expression were met by barriers. We shared examples of
                apps which are incompatible with screen readers, one of the most revolutionary inclusive technologies of
                our time. We strove to tell stories of digital exclusion in the hope that some of the tech gods who
                bestride Burning Man might listen and wield their power to remove these barriers.</p>
            <p>Ahead of launching a re-developed version of our VR world in 2023 (the live version linked in this
                article is very much “undergoing renovation”), the build team assembled ’round our Zoom campfire to
                share inspirations and lessons learned from the initial build process.</p>
            <h2 id="960c"><strong>The Initial Challenge and Strides Forward</strong></h2>
            <p><em>Blind Burners World</em> was built originally for AltspaceVR, a social VR platform experienced both
                in 2D through the desktop application and in 3D via a VR headset.</p>
            <p>For users who require non-visual feedback, such as through a screen reader, there are currently no viable
                solutions for launching VR apps like AltspaceVR, for setting up headsets or using creator tools to
                design their own VR experiences.</p>
            <p>The failure of AltspaceVR to work with screen readers meant that even the 2D version of our world could
                not be logged into and explored independently. Team members who used screen readers had to allow others
                to take control of their computers via remote access simply to enter the platform: an egregious security
                compromise.</p>
            <p>Our project goals, therefore, were just as much about hacking technologies as they were about tackling
                preconceptions around visual impairment.</p>
            <p>Chris Hainsworth, Blind Burners’ UK Co-Founder and the project’s Creative Director, offers:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>We wanted to represent diverse and powerful artists in this new medium; to playfully educate and
                    inspire tech companies such as Microsoft and Unity, whose VR software and creator tools are broken
                    and exclusionary; and to experiment in use of sound to navigate 3D spaces, foregrounding audio-led
                    design and spatial sound as innovative, playful and creatively rich.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h2 id="abce">Why VR?</h2>
            <p>This is a question frequently asked of blind artists working with VR. The assumptions that VR is a visual
                medium, and that blind- and low-vision VR-accessibility are “hard problems to be solved later,” are
                pervasive.</p>
            <p>As highlighted by our temple, access to VR is an increasingly necessary condition underlying our human
                right to access not only culture, but work, social and educational opportunities too. Beyond this, VR
                will provide rich opportunities for blind audiences and creators to innovate, as they regularly do in
                their daily lives.</p>
            <p>Marimuthu (he/him), a blind photographer, poet and PhD student in India, reflects on how his movement
                tends to be restricted in physical surroundings due to unfamiliarity or fellow pedestrians offering
                unrequested assistance. In that vein, Marimuthu shares, “VR might give us freedom of movement which will
                do a lot of good for our confidence and… motivate ourselves to face real obstacles.”</p>

                Caribbean, non-binary performing artist and photographer in England, adds:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>In a physical gallery I would be climbing up the wall to look at something really close. Or I use the
                    magnification tool on my phone, zooming in to the picture, taking in the detail section by section.
                    In VR, I can ‘zoom’ by walking closer to my photographs on the wall. It [feels] as if I [am] there
                    in the space, so that is very exciting.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2 id="2d3d">Using Sound in the Place-Making Process</h2>
            <p>To showcase our art, we sought to create a welcoming gallery, modeled visually to reflect the grace,
                openness and curvature of contemporary art buildings such as the Los Angeles Getty Museum, and inspired
                above all by the innovative, multi-sensory inclusive architecture of the <a
                    href="https://lighthouse-sf.org/about/facility/">San Francisco Lighthouse for the Blind.</a></p>
            <p>Whilst we hope that future projects will draw increasingly on tactile innovations, our current <em>Blind
                    Burners World </em>is all about spatial sound.</p>
            <p>Drawing on our team members’ experiences of navigating the world through use of sound, like when walking
                down a busy street or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnjBgeNXKrk">snowboarding down a
                    mountain</a>, we explored how a combination of non-verbal sounds and auditory descriptions could be
                deployed as guides.</p>
            <p>Pathways to locations in the camp were assigned specific sounds. Users could select one sound from
                several options and follow it to progress down a path, and the selected sound would get louder as they
                neared the location while other sounds faded into silence. We chose everyday sounds that were easy to
                recognize and associate with specific places, such as a drum loop for the path to the gallery’s rooftop
                party area.</p>
            <p>This multisensory environment was brought to life by <a href="https://linktr.ee/whittsellers">Whitt
                    Sellers</a> (he/him), an NYC-based VR developer, and Adi Laflamme (they/them), a sound designer
                based in Canada.</p>
            <p>As Adi recounts, “Putting sound first in design would provide opportunity for all kinds of different
                experiences that aren’t really possible right now, even though the technology already exists.”</p>
            <p>We also placed directional prompts at entrances and along the paths. These excerpts were recorded in the
                voice of a screen reader, paying homage to this well-known component in blind individuals’ assistive
                technology arsenal. Artists wrote and recorded the audio descriptions for their own works.</p>

            <h2 id="e295">Devising an Inclusive Production Process</h2>
            <p>During our six week sprint towards Burning Man 2021, our production process emphasized regular co-design
                and continuous user testing with blind, low vision and sighted artists.</p>
            <p>One key access strategy we used throughout our project was Audio Description, the practice of verbalizing
                visual aspects in media content for blind and low vision audiences.</p>
            <p>In our review meetings, we each described how we experienced the designs and content of our VR world and
                the user interfaces of the creator tools we were using. Rather than introducing description at
                post-production stage, as is standard for many accessibility initiatives, we did this throughout the
                development process. This meant our whole team could review designs and share our ideas while it was
                still possible to make changes. We discovered that description allowed us to openly reflect upon the
                influences and assumptions we brought to the project. That said, it wasn’t always a serious affair; a
                large inspiration for this inclusive practice came from Blind Burners’ lockdown parties on Zoom, where
                access-focused descriptions were fun, creative and our collective responsibility.</p>

            <p>Talking about the pencil sketches and 3D models he shared through description, VR Developer Whitt Sellers
                comments, “It still is a learning process around how to describe something I’m looking at or imagining
                in a helpful way. It was the first time where I’ve ever had to do that outside creative writing
                exercises in high school, describing a setting or a scene, and making it as rich as possible.”</p>
            <h2 id="360a">Challenges in Creation and Curation</h2>
            <p>Our ability to design an effective audio landscape was hindered by several limitations inherent in the
                combination of Altspace with Unity. Basic game world functions like sonifying movement or collision, let
                alone directionality were impossible for someone navigating the experience solely through sound. Without
                these, large parts of the world felt confusing and lifeless. Audio from one pathway leaked into other
                spaces, confusing visitors’ sense of direction.</p>
            <p>Our design process was further hindered by the lack of documentation around technical constraints such as
                file size and optimization. We needed to weigh the relative resource-intensity of an extra sound versus
                an extra image, the number of curves/polygons in our design versus the number of carefully placed audio
                beacons. Without this clarity, we had no reliable way to manage design trade-offs between vital
                navigational and descriptive sounds with our own creative ambitions around the gallery design and the
                breadth of our exhibition. Each artwork required an audio description, adding an extra layer to
                traditional gallerist challenges of curating our work.</p>
            <p>Just before virtual Burning Man, a technical update led to the anomaly of visitors being unable to hear
                each other speak. Members of our team watched as visitors streamed through our gallery and <em>Temple of
                    Accessibility</em>, pausing to look at our art and listen to our story. Unable to hear their
                responses to the exhibition beyond hand waves, shoulder shrugs and the limited emojis that survived the
                update, Creative Director Chris Hainsworth recalls this “feeling like the tech gods we had set out to
                provoke were having a laugh.”</p>
            <h2 id="9be4">Hopes for the Future</h2>

            <p>Encouraged by the openness and responsiveness of some tech companies involved in VR platforms and creator
                tools, we hope that our work alongside that of others, such as the <a href="https://xraccess.org/">XR
                    Access Initiative</a>, will help to course-correct VR to a more inclusive future. We expect to see
                accessible user interfaces where blind and low vision individuals can log in, set up profiles and
                avatars, launch experiences, navigate worlds, create and connect. Fundamental change will only come when
                we establish clearer career paths for blind software engineers, designers, artists and sound designers.
            </p>
            <p>As Blind Burners India Chapter Lead Marimuthu says, “People assume that visual arts are only done by
                sighted people, and I want to prove them wrong. We are blind people in Virtual Reality, it is us who are
                laughing.”</p>
            <p>Fueled by our artist collective’s truly radical self-expression, inclusion and communal efforts, we
                invite our friends across global arts and technology to accompany us into virtual worlds beyond sight,
                into a future shaped by the intelligence, wisdom and creativity of blind and low vision artists.</p>
