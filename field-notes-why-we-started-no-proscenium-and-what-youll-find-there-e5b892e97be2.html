            <p>When I started <em><a href="https://noproscenium.com/">No Proscenium</a></em> around Christmas time 2013
                it was because I needed something like it, and found it didn’t exist.</p>
            <p>For my birthday that year I had traveled to New York from my home in LA to make pilgrimage to see <em><a
                        href="https://mckittrickhotel.com/sleep-no-more/">Sleep No More</a></em> after a good year of
                tales from friends in the transmedia world. While there I also caught <em><a
                        href="https://thenshefell.com/">Then She Fell</a></em>, and it was while walking back to the
                subway in the Williamsburg night that my mind caught fire.</p>
            <p>I knew that more work like this had to exist, and that I wanted to be part of that world. I spent the
                rest of the night scribbling furious notes about what made these immersive experiments tick at an
                after-hours joint in the East Village, where a friend was playing a jazz session.</p>
            <p>When I got back to LA, I wanted to see more. I knew in my gut that others had to be making this kind of
                work on the West Coast, and before embarking on any venture of my own I wanted to know the lay of the
                land. Yet try as I might I couldn’t find a reliable source of information. I missed out on <em><a
                        href="http://invisiblecitiesopera.com/">Invisible Cities</a></em>, the large format immersive
                opera that put Yuval Sharon’s <em>The Industry</em> on the art map in LA just a few weeks after that
                trip. With that failure to catch work behind me I vowed that it wouldn’t happen again.</p>
            <p>Over Christmas, I turned to the small circle of transmedia and theatre-making friends with whom I had
                regular dinner parties where we dreamed and schemed and let them know I was leveling up our email chain
                into an actual newsletter. I’d even picked out a name, thanks to the indignities of the domain name
                hierarchy. It would be called “No Proscenium,” a terribly theatre-nerdy name but an accurate description
                of the kind of work we were obsessed with. (A proscenium is, for those blessed to not have theatre arts
                degrees, the frame through which a theatrical production is presented: the arch above the stage.)</p>

                correspondents and reviewers that reach across the globe. In the past few weeks our writers have filed

                travel budget.)</p>
            <p>At first, the aim was to build up a collective audience for the work so that when I finally got around to
                making my own there would be an audience waiting. I’ve never been all that interested in making
                community theatre or toiling away in obscurity. I spent a few years after college being enlisted as a
                performer and technician in vanity projects that showed me firsthand just how damnably toxic that
                scenario can be. Besides, what I had seen in immersive was a tonic to the dissociation that our
                internet-centered culture had created over the past twenty years.</p>
            <p>Once I was one of those romantics who believed that the internet was going to connect all of us in an
                empathetic mesh. By finding affinity groups no matter where they resided in the world, people would
                become more whole and thus more ready to lift up each other.</p>
            <p>As it turns out, that naiveté overlooked the essential experience of the internet: looking at pixels on a
                screen.</p>
            <p>Even the best transmedia work has to use every trick in the book to get around the fundamental fact that
                communication on the internet is a mediated process. Immersive work is, by its nature, immediate. While
                there are varying degrees of agency — from witness, to participant, to full-on protagonist — an
                immersive work puts people in the center of the action. When executed properly it is a powerful tool to
                create connection between the audience and the message of the work.</p>
            <p>Now I’m not so dense as to believe that immersive work is going to save us from the dissociative madness
                that has gripped society, but I do believe that immersive productions have a bias towards empathy and
                connection. While that can be used to ill ends — as any cult leader can tell you right before they rip
                you off and leave you shattered — there’s also a muscular quality to empathy. The more you are willing
                to brave, the greater your capacity becomes.</p>
            <p>Immersive work often seeks to put the audience in the shoes of the protagonist. You may, for instance,
                find your own inner monologue being replaced with that of the lead character until the point that you
                “become” her. You may find yourself going through the motions of her life, and in so doing gain visceral
                insight into the choices the way that an actor does as they research a role. Applied over a large cast
                of characters or taken in aggregate, a kaleidoscope effect comes into play: Audiences are given the
                opportunity to inhabit the perspectives of many, and not just the through-line of an arch-protagonist.
            </p>
            <p>Now this is only one of the aspects of immersive experiences. What’s been exciting for me over the past
                five years has been to see all the ways that the work has evolved, all the different forms — both
                physical and digital, and those that merge the two — which have come into play.</p>
            <p>At NoPro we do what we can to track it all: theatre, hybrid VR/live, escape rooms, immersive theme parks,
                marketing activations. We do that with the help of a passionate and dedicated volunteer team — I call
                them the “pirate armada” — who feel the same pull that I do to discover new work and build a world where
                creators can one day have sustainable careers in the arts instead of making it their side hustle.</p>

            <p>While the newsletter, podcast, blog, and Facebook groups and Slack channels have yet to become my own day
                job, I take heart in knowing that the work continues to build an audience. Every few months we take down
                another wall that seemingly separates the communities that are developing this form and bring them into
                the same space where they learn and grow together. (This is something we literally do at the <a
                    href="http://immersivedesignsummit.com/">Immersive Design Summit</a>, which we co-produce. Well,
                maybe not literally take down walls. Our venues wouldn’t be happy about that.)</p>
            <p>One day I may finally get around to producing an immersive theatre piece of my own, but for now I’ve
                found my calling… and there’s plenty of work to go around.</p>
