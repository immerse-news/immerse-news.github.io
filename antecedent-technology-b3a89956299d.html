            <p>In data science, we talk about models suffering from either “overfitting” or “underfitting.”
                <em>Overfitting</em> is when a model exhibits a low degree of bias, but a high degree of variance. In
                other words, it accepts a lot of differences within the data, but it doesn’t have very much predictive
                power. <em>Underfitting</em> is the inverse of this — high bias, low variance. This is what happens when
                you make a generalization without enough data, or with data that is not diverse enough to represent the
                real world.
            </p>
            <p>It is said that those who fail to study history are doomed to repeat it. I would rephrase it: those who
                ignore data have <a href="https://www.yourdictionary.com/underfit">underfitted</a> models.</p>
            <p>When Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin were looking for a new model to serve as a basis for the
                United States government, and they were very impressed by the Iroquois Confederacy (Hodenoshoune, People
                of the Longhouse, Made up of the Seneca, Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga, Mohawk, Tuscarora). Thomas Jefferson
                spent a year with the Iroquois in upstate New York, in one of their large cities of a very sizable
                portion of the U.S. and Canada.</p>

            <p>Later, when drafting the constitution, the founders cherry-picked the parts of Iroquois statecraft that
                best aligned with western Enlightenment-era ideology: representation, voting, checks and balances, etc.
                What they left out were the social and cultural networks that sustained these practices in the actual
                Iroquois Confederacy.</p>
            <p>In the Iroquois constitution, women (clan-mothers) from each tribe were the only ones who could vote for
                the representative, who was always a man, a chief. There was a balance of power—only men could serve,
                only women could vote. Iroquois farming differed radically from the agricultural economy of European
                settlers, which was inextricably bound up with chattel slavery. In Iroquois society, everyone in the
                community participated in planting and harvesting.</p>
            <p>The founders’ selective pilfering of Iroquois political practices is an example of a colonial mindset.
                <em>I see it; I like it; I want it; I’ll take it.</em> I take what will benefit my own political or
                material interests, but I’m unconcerned with the effect that it will have on the people I take it from.
            </p>
            <p>What’s wrong with “colonizing” a concept? It’s not like a natural resource of a piece of land. Ideas are
                not a zero-sum game. We all have colonial mindset no matter who we are, just because our culture has a
                colonial mindset. No need to beat ourselves up over it though, right?</p>
            <p>But taking an idea out of context is like plucking a plant out of its soil. You lose everything that made
                the thought work in the first place. What if it turns out that confederate democracy (or lasting peace
                and prosperity) is dependent upon a balance of power along gendered lines? Or upon a different economic
                model than the one practiced by European settlers in North America? Or requires a system of agriculture
                where the environment is protected and maintains sustainable practices?</p>
            <p>In other words, the problem with colonial mindset is one of underfitting. It encourages us to believe we
                know more than we do, to premise our thinking on bad analogies. It is like trying to run a program
                without checking its dependencies — the program will produce weird artifacts, or crash completely, and
                we will be left holding the bag and scratching our heads.</p>

            <p>For instance, let’s say you want to lay the groundwork for a society run on the blockchain. What would
                that look like? How would that work? What kind of consequences should we expect? Silicon Valley
                orthodoxy would have us move fast and break stuff. Wing it, basically, and hope we learn enough from our
                failures to make incremental improvements in the next release.</p>
            <p>But we have thousands of years of data about decentralized economies. The use of <a
                    href="https://www.studioamelia.com/page-portfolio/immersive-technology/decentralized-storytelling/">Wampum
                </a>among the Iroquois functioned as a decentralized, distributed ledger of contracts, and it helped us
                govern our society for centuries.</p>

            <p>Wampum is an example of what I’ve termed “antecedent technologies” and there are many more cases like
                this. Antecedent technologies are techniques or systems that preceded European contact (or in Europe,
                ideas that preceded the Enlightenment). These old school technologists advanced sciences before the
                western world ‘invented’ the very same things. When cultures share and trade, they trade technology as
                well — but it is important to not conflate when they were invented with the first time a western person
                encountered it or remixed it.</p>

            <p>The Incan knot-language of quipu, for instance<a href="https://projects.csail.mit.edu/khipu/"> has been
                    shown</a> to be Turing-complete, meaning the system is logically robust enough to support any
                computational operation with a modern programming language. Quipu inspires modern storytellers as well,
                an example is the expanded media documentary <em>The </em><em><a

                    href="https://docubase.mit.edu/project/quipu-project/">.</a></p>
            <p>When we want to use powerful new technologies such as artificial intelligence or blockchain, we want as
                much data as we can to help us imagine positive change in the world. We do not need to throw out
                thousands of years of data that can fuel the next giant leaps our communities will make with technology.
                To proceed forward with a colonial mindset is to colonize the future.</p>
            <p>Our plans for the future need to include more data from diverse cultures and societies, and not only
                those ideas that can serve our narrow interests or flatter what we already believe. A future that
                includes us all must be grounded in a thorough understanding of where we already are, and where we have
                come from.</p>
            <p><em>The foregoing is just a small dip into the concept of antecedent technologies. Over the next several
                    months, I am embarking on a passion project looking at Wampum and its relationship to storytelling,
                    our U.S. constitution, decentralized systems and our future beyond colonial mindset.</em></p>
            <p><em>I’ve created a research framework to study antecedent technology, the first project of which is
                    Wampum.codes. I’m working with other Seneca and Seneca-Cayuga women (I am Seneca-Cayuga Nation of
                    Oklahoma, Deer Clan) to talk about our relationships with our traditional knowledge, the
                    technologies we use to share our stories and how we hope to contribute to our community.</em></p>
            <p><em>This project was inspired by the long conversations I had with Kamal Sinclair, Executive Director of
                    the Guild of Future Architects, and Kat Cizek, director of the Co-Creation studio at MIT, when we
