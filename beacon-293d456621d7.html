            <p>Stu Campbell is a talented Australian artist who has done a lot of work in AR and VR, including Inside
                Manus for SBS and <a href="https://www.ryot.org/films/mind-at-war/">Mind at War</a> for Ryot. He’s also
                known for his interactive comics, including <em><a href="http://www.nawlz.com/hq">Nawlz</a></em>, <a
                    href="http://www.neomadcomic.com/">Neomad</a>, <em><a href="http://www.modernpolaxis.com/">Modern

                        Last.</a></em> Much of his work has been collaborative; for example, the wonderfully imaginative
                NEOMAD was created with the help of more than 40 young people in the Ieramugadu (Roebourne) community in
                Australia through a series of workshops over an 18-month period. The story involves spy bots, magic
                crystals, fallen rocket boosters, and mysterious petroglyphs. All the good stuff.</p>
